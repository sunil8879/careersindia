                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> Para Jumbles are a set of related sentences that have been mixed up or "jumbled." The goal is to rearrange these sentences into their original, logical order to form a coherent and meaningful paragraph.
                </div>
                <h3>Why is it important for competitive exams?</h3>
                <p>This question type is a pure test of logic and reading comprehension. It assesses a candidate's ability to understand the flow of ideas, identify connections between sentences, and reconstruct a well-structured piece of writing. It does not rely on complex grammar rules but on reasoning skills.</p>

                <h2>Strategies for Solving Para Jumbles</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    The key to solving Para Jumbles is not to read the sentences randomly, but to actively look for links and clues that establish a definite order.
                </div>
                <h3>Key Strategies & Tricks</h3>
                <ul class="strategy-list">
                    <li><strong>1. Find the Opening Sentence:</strong> This is the most crucial step. The opening sentence introduces the main topic, a person, or a concept. It is usually a general statement.
                        <ul>
                           <li>It will **NOT** start with pronouns that refer to a previous noun (e.g., `he`, `it`, `they`, `this`, `that`).</li>
                           <li>It will **NOT** start with transition words that indicate a continuation (e.g., `but`, `so`, `therefore`, `also`, `however`, `finally`).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2. Identify Mandatory Pairs:</strong> After finding a potential opening, look for sentences that have an unbreakable logical link.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pronoun-Antecedent Link:</strong> A sentence with a pronoun (e.g., `he`, `its`) must follow the sentence that introduces the noun it refers to. (e.g., A sentence about `Ashoka` must come before a sentence starting with `He...`).</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronological Order:</strong> Arrange events based on the sequence of time (e.g., look for dates, or words like `first`, `then`, `next`, `finally`).</li>
                            <li><strong>Cause and Effect Link:</strong> The sentence describing a cause will come before the sentence describing its effect (look for words like `because`, `therefore`, `as a result`).</li>
                            <li><strong>Idea-Example Link:</strong> A sentence presenting a general idea will come before a sentence that gives a specific example of it (look for words like `For instance`, `For example`).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>3. Find the Concluding Sentence:</strong> This sentence summarizes the paragraph, provides a final thought, or states a conclusion. It often starts with words like `Thus`, `Therefore`, `Hence`, `Finally`, or `Ultimately`.</li>
                </ul>

D explains how 'It' (the telephone) worked. A better flow is B -> D -> A -> C. Let's re-examine. B states the fact. D explains its function. C provides a contrast to the situation before the phone. A summarizes the impact. So, BDCA seems most logical. Wait, B->D->A is a strong chain. B introduces. D explains how it works. A gives the overall impact. C provides a historical contrast which can fit after A. So, BDAC. No, the contrast fits better earlier. Let's try BCAD. B introduces. C contrasts with the past. A gives the overall impact. D explains *how* it had that impact. This is disjointed. The best flow is B -> D, as D explains *what* the telephone did. A explains the *result* of what it did. C provides a historical look-back. So, BDAC is a good candidate. Let's try BCAD again. B->C (Invention -> Situation before it). A->D (Impact -> How it worked). Doesn't flow. Let's stick with BDAC or a similar structure. **Final Answer: BDCA**. B introduces. D explains function. C contrasts. A concludes. This is logical. Let's try **BCAD** again. B introduces the telephone. C describes the 'before' situation. A describes the impact. D explains how it had that impact. This also seems logical. Let's check the pronoun links. B->C ('this' refers to the invention). This seems very strong. A->D ('It' refers to the telephone). B->C->A->D. Let's read it: The telephone was invented... Before this... This invention revolutionized... It allowed... This flows perfectly. So, BCAD is correct.</div>
