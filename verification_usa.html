        <strong>Overall Process (From Initial Query to Landing in the USA)</strong>

        <h3>Phase 1: Foundation & Strategy (3-6 Months)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 1: Initial Query & Comprehensive Profile Assessment</h4>
                <p>The student makes an initial query. The consultant conducts an in-depth analysis of the student's academic background, financial status, career aspirations, and extracurricular activities.</p>
                <p class="doc-list"><strong>Initial Documents Required:</strong> Academic transcripts from Class 9 onwards, including university marksheets; Passport copy; List of extracurricular achievements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 2: Standardized Test Preparation & Execution</h4>
                <p>Unlike many other countries, the US heavily relies on standardized tests. The consultant advises on which tests are needed and helps create a study plan.</p>
                <p class="doc-list">
                    <strong>Tests to Prepare For:</strong><br>
                    - <span class="acronym">SAT/ACT</span> (Scholastic Assessment Test / American College Testing) for undergraduate admissions.<br>
                    - <span class="acronym">GRE/GMAT</span> (Graduate Record Examinations / Graduate Management Admission Test) for graduate/business school admissions.<br>
                    - English Proficiency: <span class="acronym">TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo</span> (Test of English as a Foreign Language / International English Language Testing System).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 3: University Shortlisting & Application Strategy</h4>
                <p>Based on the student's profile and test scores, the consultant creates a balanced list of 6-8 universities, categorized as "Ambitious" (dream schools), "Target" (good fit), and "Safe" (high chance of admission). The strategy considers program, location, cost, and ranking.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Phase 2: The Application Grind (3-6 Months)</h3>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>
                <h4>Step 4: Crafting the Application Packet</h4>
                <p>This is the most intensive stage. The consultant provides guidance on preparing a holistic application packet that showcases the student's strengths.</p>
                <p class="doc-list">
                    <strong>Key Application Components:</strong><br>
                    - <strong>Application Form:</strong> Filled out via the "Common Application" (<span class="acronym">Common App</span>) for undergraduates or the university's specific portal for graduates.<br>
                    - <strong>Essays:</strong> Writing a compelling <span class="acronym">SOP (Statement of Purpose)</span> or Personal Statement, along with multiple university-specific "Supplemental Essays".<br>
                    - <strong><span class="acronym">LORs</span> (Letters of Recommendation):</strong> Securing 2-3 strong recommendations from professors, school counselors, or employers.<br>
                    - <strong>Financial Documents:</strong> Preparing an "Affidavit of Support" and collecting bank statements to prove the ability to fund the entire duration of study.<br>
                    - <strong>Transcript Evaluation:</strong> Some universities may require transcripts to be evaluated by a third-party service like <span class="acronym">WES (World Education Services)</span>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 5: Application Submission and Monitoring</h4>
                <p>The consultant ensures all components are submitted correctly before strict deadlines (e.g., Early Decision in November, Regular Decision in January). They then help the student track the application status through university portals.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Phase 3: Admission & I-20 Form (1-3 Months)</h3>
        <ol start="6">
            <li>
                <h4>Step 6: Receiving Admission Decisions</h4>
                <p>Universities typically release decisions between March and April. The student receives an official admission letter (or rejection/waitlist notification). The consultant helps compare offers and make a final decision.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 7: Securing the Form I-20</h4>
                <p>After accepting an offer and paying an enrollment deposit, the student submits final financial proof to the university. The university's <span class="acronym">DSO (Designated School Official)</span> then issues the crucial <strong>Form I-20</strong>, officially titled the "Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status". This document is required to apply for the F-1 student visa.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Phase 4: The Visa Hurdle (1-3 Months)</h3>
        <ol start="8">
            <li>
                <h4>Step 8: F-1 Visa Application Logistics</h4>
                <p>The consultant guides the student through the meticulous visa application steps:</p>
                <p class="doc-list">
                    1. <strong>Pay the <span class="acronym">SEVIS</span> I-901 Fee:</strong> The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System fee that funds the program.<br>
                    2. <strong>Complete the DS-160 Form:</strong> An extensive online nonimmigrant visa application form.<br>
                    3. <strong>Pay the Visa Application Fee (MRV Fee).</strong><br>
                    4. <strong>Schedule Appointments:</strong> Book two separate appointments – one for biometrics (fingerprinting) and one for the visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 9: The F-1 Visa Interview</h4>
                <p>This is a mandatory, in-person interview and the most critical step. The consular officer's primary goal is to assess three things:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><strong>Academic Intent:</strong> Are you a genuine student with a clear plan?</li>
                        <li><strong>Financial Stability:</strong> Can you afford your education and living costs without working illegally?</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-Immigrant Intent:</strong> Do you have strong ties to your home country (family, job prospects, property) that will ensure you return after completing your studies? This is the most important factor.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>The consultant's role is crucial here, conducting several rounds of mock interviews to prepare the student for questions like, "Why this university?", "Who is sponsoring you?", and "What are your plans after graduation?".</p>
                <p class="doc-list"><strong>Documents to Carry to the Interview:</strong> Passport, I-20, DS-160 confirmation, SEVIS fee receipt, visa appointment letter, all original academic documents, standardized test score reports, and original financial documents.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Phase 5: Final Documentation & Departure (1-2 Months)</h3>
        <ol start="10">
            <li>
                <h4>Step 10: Pre-Departure Formalities</h4>
                <p>Once the visa is approved and stamped in the passport, the consultant assists with final preparations. This includes pre-departure orientation sessions covering US culture, academic expectations, accommodation arrangements, flight bookings, and foreign currency exchange.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 11: Landing in the USA</h4>
                <p>The process is not over until the student clears immigration at the US port of entry. The student must present their passport with the F-1 visa and the signed Form I-20 to a <span class="acronym">CBP (Customs and Border Protection)</span> officer. The officer will ask a few basic questions and, upon satisfaction, will stamp the passport, officially granting entry into the United States in F-1 status.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
