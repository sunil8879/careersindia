                <h2>Definition & Concept</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> A phrasal verb is a multi-word verb made up of a main verb and at least one particle (a preposition or an adverb). The meaning of the phrasal verb is often idiomatic, meaning it is very different from the meanings of the individual words.
                </div>
                <h3>Why are they important?</h3>
                <p>Phrasal verbs are extremely common in everyday, informal English. Mastering them is essential for understanding native speakers and for success in Reading Comprehension, Cloze Tests, and Sentence Completion questions in competitive exams.</p>
                <ul class="example-list">
                    <li>`give` (to offer) + `up` (direction) → <span class="feature">give up</span> (to quit)</li>
                    <li>`look` (to see) + `after` (position) → <span class="feature">look after</span> (to take care of)</li>
                    <li>`break` (to shatter) + `down` (direction) → <span class="feature">break down</span> (to stop functioning)</li>

                <h2>Rules & Syntax</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    <h3>Key Syntactical Categories</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Transitive vs. Intransitive:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Transitive</strong> phrasal verbs need a direct object. (e.g., *She <strong>turned down</strong> the offer.*)</li>
                                <li><strong>Intransitive</strong> phrasal verbs do not take an object. (e.g., *The car <strong>broke down</strong>.*)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Separable vs. Inseparable:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Separable</strong> (Transitive): The object can come between the verb and the particle. (e.g., *She <strong>turned</strong> the offer <strong>down</strong>.* OR *She <strong>turned down</strong> the offer.*)
                                <br><strong>Note:</strong> If the object is a pronoun, it MUST come in between. (e.g., *She <strong>turned</strong> it <strong>down</strong>.*)</li>
                                <li><strong>Inseparable</strong> (Transitive or Intransitive): The verb and particle must stay together. (e.g., *I will <strong>look into</strong> the matter.* NOT *I will look the matter into.*)</li>
                            </ul>

                <h2>How to Identify Phrasal Verbs</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    Identifying phrasal verbs is primarily about vocabulary and context, not a specific grammatical trick.
                </div>
                <h3>A 3-Step Guide to Identification</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>1. Look for a `Verb + Particle` combination:</strong> Spot a main verb followed immediately by a small word like `up`, `down`, `in`, `on`, `off`, `away`, `out`, `about`.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Check the Meaning:</strong> Ask yourself if the combination has a figurative or idiomatic meaning that is different from the individual words. For example, in "He looked up the word," 'look up' doesn't mean to physically look in an upward direction; it means 'to research'.</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Differentiate from Prepositional Verbs:</strong> In a simple prepositional verb, the verb and preposition keep their literal meanings (e.g., "He walked up the hill."). In a phrasal verb, the meaning is new and idiomatic (e.g., "He made up a story.").</li>
