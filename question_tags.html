                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> A question tag is a mini-question that is added to the end of a statement. Its primary purpose is to ask for confirmation or to check if the other person agrees with the statement. It essentially turns a statement into a question.
                </div>
                <h3>Where and How They Are Used</h3>
                <p>Question tags are very common in spoken English. In competitive exams, they are frequently tested in "Fill in the Blanks" and "Sentence Correction" sections. The key is to correctly identify the helping verb and the pronoun required for the tag.</p>
                <ul class="example-list">
                    <li>Statement: It's a beautiful day.</li>
                    <li>Question Tag: ..., isn't it?</li>
                    <li>Full Sentence: It's a beautiful day, <span class="feature">isn't it?</span></li>

                <div class="rule">
                    <h3>Core Rule: The Rule of Opposites</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the main statement is **positive**, the question tag must be **negative**.</li>
                        <li>If the main statement is **negative**, the question tag must be **positive**.</li>

                    <h3>Syntax: `Helping Verb + Pronoun?`</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Helping Verb:** The tag uses the same helping verb (or modal) from the main statement (e.g., `is`, `are`, `has`, `have`, `will`, `can`). If there is no helping verb (as in simple present/past), use a form of `do` (`do`, `does`, `did`).</li>
                        <li>**Pronoun:** The tag always uses a pronoun (`I`, `you`, `he`, `she`, `it`, `we`, `they`) that matches the subject of the statement.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Check if the statement is positive or negative.</strong> This will determine if your tag should be positive or negative. Remember that words like `never`, `hardly`, `seldom`, `nobody`, `nothing` make a statement negative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Identify the helping verb or main verb.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If there's a helping verb (`is`, `are`, `was`, `have`, `will`, `can`, etc.), use the same verb in the tag.</li>
                            <li>If there's only a main verb, use `do`, `does`, or `did` based on the tense.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Identify the subject and replace it with a pronoun.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>'The boy' → `he`</li>
