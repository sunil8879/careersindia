                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> Parallelism, also known as parallel structure, is a grammatical rule which states that elements in a sentence that are alike in function must also be alike in structure (form). It's about creating balance and rhythm in your writing.
                </div>
                <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                <p>Parallelism makes sentences clearer, more elegant, and easier to understand. A lack of parallelism can make sentences sound awkward and confusing. It is one of the most frequently tested topics in sentence correction sections of competitive exams.</p>
                <ul class="example-list">
                    <li><span class="incorrect">Not Parallel:</span> She likes to swim, hiking, and to ride a bicycle.</li>
                    <li><span class="correct">Parallel:</span> She likes <span class="feature">to swim</span>, <span class="feature">to hike</span>, and <span class="feature">to ride</span> a bicycle.</li>
                    <li><span class="correct">Also Parallel:</span> She likes <span class="feature">swimming</span>, <span class="feature">hiking</span>, and <span class="feature">riding</span> a bicycle.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section id="rules" class="content-section">
                <h2>Rules & Syntax</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Syntax:</strong> Parallelism applies to words, phrases, and clauses.
                </div>
                <h3>Where and How to Use Parallel Structure</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1. With Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS):</strong> When connecting items with `for`, `and`, `nor`, `but`, `or`, `yet`, `so`, ensure the items have the same grammatical form.
                        <ul><li>Example: He is <span class="feature">tall</span>, <span class="feature">strong</span>, and <span class="feature">handsome</span>. (Parallel adjectives)</li></ul>
                    </li>
                     <li><strong>2. With Correlative Conjunctions:</strong> The grammatical structure following the first part of the pair must match the structure following the second part. Common pairs are `not only...but also`, `either...or`, `neither...nor`, `both...and`.
                        <ul><li>Example: She is not only <span class="feature">a great singer</span> but also <span class="feature">an excellent dancer</span>. (Parallel noun phrases)</li></ul>
                    </li>
                     <li><strong>3. In Comparisons:</strong> When comparing two things using words like `than` or `as`, the items being compared should be grammatically parallel.
                        <ul><li>Example: <span class="feature">Working hard</span> is better than <span class="feature">not working</span> at all. (Parallel gerund phrases)</li></ul>
                    </li>
                     <li><strong>4. In Lists or Series:</strong> All items in a list, whether separated by commas or semicolons, should be in the same form.
                        <ul><li>Example: The manager's duties are <span class="feature">hiring new employees</span>, <span class="feature">training the staff</span>, and <span class="feature">evaluating performance</span>. (Parallel gerund phrases)</li></ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Identify Parallelism Errors</h2>

                    <strong>How to Identify:</strong> Spotting these errors requires a systematic approach.

                <ol class="example-list decimal">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Find the Conjunction/Marker:</strong> First, look for the words that link items together. These are your triggers.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Coordinating Conjunctions: `and`, `but`, `or`.</li>
                            <li>Correlative Conjunctions: `not only...but also`, `either...or`, `neither...nor`.</li>
                            <li>Comparison Words: `than`, `as`.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Identify the Items in the List/Comparison:</strong> Carefully identify the words, phrases, or clauses that are being linked by the conjunction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Check for Grammatical Balance:</strong> Compare the grammatical form of each item in the list. Are they all nouns? All infinitives (`to + verb`)? All gerunds (`-ing` nouns)? All prepositional phrases? If you find a mix of different forms, you have found a parallelism error.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <strong>Example Analysis:</strong> `The witness spoke calmly and with confidence.`<br>
                    1. <strong>Conjunction:</strong> `and`.<br>
                    2. <strong>Items in List:</strong> The first item is `calmly`. The second item is `with confidence`.<br>
                    3. <strong>Check Balance:</strong> `calmly` is an adverb. `with confidence` is a prepositional phrase. They are not in the same grammatical form. This is a parallelism error.<br>
                    <strong>Correction:</strong> `The witness spoke calmly and confidently.` (Two adverbs).
