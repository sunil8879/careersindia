                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Introducing a man to her husband, a woman named Priya said, “His brother’s father is the only son of my grandfather.” How is Priya related to the man?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Sister</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This is solved by breaking down Priya's statement from her perspective:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"my grandfather"</strong>: This refers to Priya's own grandfather.</li>
                    <li><strong>"the only son of my grandfather"</strong>: The only son of Priya's grandfather must be Priya's father.</li>
                    <li><strong>"His brother’s father"</strong>: This is the man's father.</li>
                    <li>By equating the statements, we understand that the man's father is the same person as Priya's father. If they share the same father, Priya and the man are siblings. Therefore, Priya is his sister.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> For these "pointing" or "introducing" problems, the key is to always start the analysis from the phrase containing "my" or "your." Work backward from that anchor point, resolving each relationship step by step from the speaker's perspective. This method untangles the puzzle logically and avoids confusion.</p>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Pointing to a man in a photograph, a boy named Leo said, “His mother’s only daughter is my mother.” How is Leo related to the man in the photograph?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Nephew</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We solve this by deconstructing Leo's statement:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"His mother's only daughter"</strong>: "His" refers to the man in the photograph. The only daughter of his mother is his sister.</li>
                    <li><strong>"is my mother"</strong>: Leo is stating that the man's sister is his (Leo's) mother.</li>
                    <li>Therefore, Leo is the son of the man's sister. The son of one's sister is their nephew.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The phrase "only daughter" is a critical piece of information that establishes a definite relationship (sister). Identifying these definitive clues is crucial. The logic flows from the man in the photo to his sister, and then from his sister to her son, Leo.</p>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>There are six members in a family. Alex is the father of David. Ethan is the grandfather of David. Bella is the daughter-in-law of Clara. Frank is the uncle of David. What is the relationship of Clara with Frank?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Data inadequate</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>When we attempt to draw a family tree, we get two disconnected groups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Group 1:</strong> Ethan is the grandfather of David, and Alex is the father of David. This means Ethan is Alex's father. Frank is David's uncle, so Frank is Alex's brother. This forms one complete family branch: (Ethan → [Alex, Frank] → David).</li>
                    <li><strong>Group 2:</strong> Bella is the daughter-in-law of Clara. This means Clara has a son, who is married to Bella. This forms a separate family unit.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since Clara (from Group 2) and Frank (from Group 1) are in completely separate family trees based on the given information, it is impossible to determine their relationship.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The goal in puzzle questions is to create a single, unified family tree. If the provided clues result in two or more separate, unlinked family groups, you cannot determine relationships between individuals from different groups. In such cases, the answer is "Data inadequate."</p>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Study the following codes: <br>
                A $ B means A is the father of B <br>
                A @ B means B is the mother of A <br>
                A * B means A is the wife of B <br>
                A # B means B is the daughter of A <br>
                Given the expression `A * B $ C # D @ E`, how is ‘B’ related to ‘D’?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Grandfather</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We build the family tree by decoding the expression step-by-step:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>A * B:</strong> A is the wife of B. (A is female, B is male).</li>
                    <li><strong>B $ C:</strong> B is the father of C. (C is B's child).</li>
                    <li><strong>C # D:</strong> D is the daughter of C. (C is D's parent, and D is female).</li>
                    <li><strong>D @ E:</strong> E is the mother of D. (This means C and E are a married couple, where C is the father and E is the mother of D).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the tree, B is the father of C, and C is the father of D. Therefore, B is the paternal grandfather of D.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> In coded relations, it is critical to pay attention to the direction of the relationship. For example, `A @ B` means `B is the mother of A`, not the other way around. Carefully translating each symbol into a generation and gender relationship is the key to building an accurate family tree and avoiding errors.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Nitin starts traveling towards the South and covers a distance of 5 km. He then turns left and travels 8 km. Finally, he takes another left turn and travels 5 km. How far is he from the starting point?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>8 km</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>Let's trace Nitin's path:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Starts at point A and moves 5 km South to point B.</li>
                    <li>From South, a left turn is towards the East. He moves 8 km East to point C.</li>
                    <li>From East, a left turn is towards the North. He moves 5 km North to point D.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>His 5 km Southward journey (A to B) is cancelled out by his 5 km Northward journey (C to D). This means his final point D is horizontally aligned with his starting point A. The only distance separating them is the 8 km he traveled East. Therefore, he is 8 km from his starting point.</p>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The most effective way to solve such problems is to track the net displacement on the North-South and East-West axes. Here, the net North-South movement is `(-5 km) + (+5 km) = 0 km`. The net East-West movement is `+8 km`. The final distance is the result of these net movements.</p>

                <p>Raju drives 25 km North and turns left, traveling 5 km to reach point ‘O’. He then turns right and covers another 5 km. Afterwards, he turns to the East and drives 5 km. How much distance does he have to travel to go back to the starting point?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>30 km</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>Let's trace Raju's path from starting point A:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Drives 25 km North from A to a point (let's call it B).</li>
                    <li>Turns left (West) and travels 5 km to point O.</li>
                    <li>From O, he turns right (North) and travels 5 km to a point (let's call it C).</li>
                    <li>From C, he turns East and travels 5 km. Since he just traveled 5 km West, this brings him directly back above point B.</li>

                <p>His final position is 5 km North of B. Since B was 25 km North of the start (A), his final position is `25 + 5 = 30 km` North of his starting point. To travel back, he must cover this distance.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>I am facing North. I turn 100° in the clockwise direction and then 145° in the anti-clockwise direction. Which direction am I facing now?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>North-West</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We can calculate the net rotation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clockwise is positive (+100°), and anti-clockwise is negative (-145°).</li>
                    <li>Net rotation = `+100° - 145° = -45°`.</li>
                    <li>A negative rotation means an anti-clockwise turn from the starting direction.</li>
                    <li>Starting from North, a 45° anti-clockwise turn leads to the North-West direction.</li>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> When multiple turns are involved, calculating the net rotation is far more efficient than plotting each turn individually. Treat one direction (e.g., clockwise) as positive and the other as negative, then find the sum to get the final effective turn.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> At 8:00 AM, the sun is in the East.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shadow Direction:</strong> A shadow is always cast in the direction opposite to the sun. Therefore, the shadow will be in the West.</li>
                    <li><strong>Person's Orientation:</strong> The person sees the shadow to his **right**. For a person's right-hand side to be pointing West, they must be facing South.</li>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Arun walked 20 m towards South. Then, he turned to his left and walked 25 m. He then turned to his left and walked 20 m. He again turned to his right and walked 15 m. At what distance is he from the starting point and in which direction?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>40 m, East</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>Let's trace Arun's path from a starting point (A):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Walks 20 m South from A to B.</li>
                    <li>Turns left (East) and walks 25 m from B to C.</li>
                    <li>Turns left (North) and walks 20 m from C to D. At this point, D is 25 m East of the start (A).</li>
                    <li>Turns right (East) and walks another 15 m from D to E.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>His total distance from the starting point is the total eastward displacement: `25 m + 15 m = 40 m`. His final direction from the starting point is East.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>In a certain code, `GLAMOUR` is written as `IJCNMWP` and `MISRULE` is written as `OGUSSNC`. How will `TOPICAL` be written in that code?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>VMRJACJ</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This is a mixed pattern based on letter positions. Analyzing the first word, `GLAMOUR`:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>G (+2) → I</li>
                    <li>L (-2) → J</li>
                    <li>A (+2) → C</li>
                    <li>M (+1) → N (Middle letter)</li>
                    <li>O (-2) → M</li>
                    <li>U (+2) → W</li>
                    <li>R (-2) → P</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The pattern is `+2, -2, +2, +1, -2, +2, -2`. Applying this same complex pattern to the word `TOPICAL` gives the result `VMRJACJ`.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> When a simple `+n` or `-n` shift doesn't work for the whole word, check for an alternating or mixed pattern. Write the positional values of the letters to clearly see the mathematical relationship. Providing two examples (GLAMOUR and MISRULE) confirms that the complex pattern is consistent and must be applied.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The coding rule is `Letter's Value = (Standard Alphabetical Position) x 2`.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>L:</strong> 12th letter → 12 x 2 = 24</li>
                    <li><strong>A:</strong> 1st letter → 1 x 2 = 2</li>
                    <li><strong>D:</strong> 4th letter → 4 x 2 = 8</li>
                    <li><strong>Y:</strong> 25th letter → 25 x 2 = 50</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The total value is the sum: `24 + 2 + 8 + 50 = 84`.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>24153</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This is a direct substitution code where each letter is assigned a specific digit. We can build a decoding key from the given examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From PALE → P=2, A=1, L=3, E=4</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Using this key, we can now code the word PEARL:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>P → 2</li>
                    <li>E → 4</li>
                    <li>A → 1</li>
                    <li>R → 5</li>
                    <li>L → 3</li>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This is a direct substitution puzzle.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, identify the actual answer to the question: The real color of leaves is **Green**.</li>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>In a certain code language:<br>
                ‘Sue Re Nik’ means ‘She is Brave’<br>
                ‘Pi Sor Re Nik’ means ‘She is always smiling’<br>
                ‘Sor Re Zhi’ means ‘Is always cheerful’<br>
                What is the code for the word ‘smiling’?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Pi</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We solve this by finding common words and their corresponding common codes across the sentences.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Compare sentence 1 and 2: The common words are 'She is' and the common codes are 'Re Nik'. So, 'She is' = 'Re Nik'.</li>
                    <li>Compare sentence 2 and 3: The common words are 'is always' and the common codes are 'Sor Re'.</li>
                    <li>From these, we can deduce: 'is' = 'Re'. This means 'She' = 'Nik' and 'always' = 'Sor'.</li>
                    <li>Now look at sentence 2 again: ‘Pi Sor Re Nik’ means ‘She is always smiling’. We have already decoded 'Sor' (always), 'Re' (is), and 'Nik' (She).</li>
                    <li>The only remaining word is 'smiling' and the only remaining code is 'Pi'. Therefore, 'smiling' = 'Pi'.</li>

                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The key to Chinese Coding is systematic comparison and elimination. Compare two sentences at a time, identify the common word(s) and the common code(s). This allows you to create a definite match. Repeat this process until you have isolated the code for the word you need.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>In a certain code, `BRAIN` is written as `*%÷#X` and `TIER` is written as `$#+%`. How is `RENT` written in that code?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>%+X$</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This is a direct substitution code where each letter corresponds to a specific symbol. We create a key by observing the given examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From `BRAIN`: B=*, R=%, A=÷, I=#, N=X</li>
                    <li>From `TIER`: T=$, I=#, E=+, R=%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now we use this key to code the word `RENT`:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>R → %</li>
                    <li>E → +</li>
                    <li>N → X</li>
                    <li>T → $</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The resulting code is `%+X$`. </p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> Just like with number substitution, this relies on building a complete decoding key. Finding the common letters ('R' and 'I' in this case) and verifying that their symbols are consistent across both examples confirms that it's a simple one-to-one substitution.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>A word is represented by only one set of numbers as given in any one of the alternatives. Using the matrices below, identify the set for the word ‘MAPS’.</p>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kx2aB1q.png" alt="Matrix Coding Example 1">
                <p>Options:<br>
                a) 65, 22, 43, 02<br>
                b) 68, 14, 00, 04<br>
                c) 99, 34, 13, 24<br>
                d) 95, 01, 31, 40</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>b) 68, 14, 00, 04</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>In matrix coding, a letter's code is formed by its row number first, then its column number. We test the options against the word `MAPS`.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Test Option (b): 68, 14, 00, 04</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>M = 68?</strong> Go to Row 6, Column 8 in Matrix-II. The letter is M. (Correct)</li>
                        <li><strong>A = 14?</strong> Go to Row 1, Column 4 in Matrix-I. The letter is A. (Correct)</li>
                        <li><strong>P = 00?</strong> Go to Row 0, Column 0 in Matrix-I. The letter is P. (Correct)</li>
                        <li><strong>S = 04?</strong> Go to Row 0, Column 4 in Matrix-I. The letter is S. (Correct)</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <p>Since all the codes in option (b) correctly match the letters of the word MAPS, it is the right answer.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The most efficient method for solving matrix problems is the **elimination method**. Start with the first letter of the word (M) and the first number in each option. Check option (a): Is M at 65? No, B is at 65. So, option (a) is wrong. Move to option (b): Is M at 68? Yes. Proceed to check the next letter. This process of checking one letter at a time and eliminating wrong options is much faster than finding all possible codes for every letter.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We use the elimination method by checking each option against the word `JUDGE`.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Test Option (a):</strong> `13` for J. Row 1, Col 3 is R. Incorrect. Eliminate (a).</li>
                    <li><strong>Test Option (b):</strong> `00` for J. Row 0, Col 0 is J. Correct. Next, `30` for U. Row 3, Col 0 is U. Correct. Next, `56` for D. Row 5, Col 6 is M. Incorrect. Eliminate (b).</li>
                    <li><strong>Test Option (c):</strong> `42` for J. Row 4, Col 2 is J. Correct. Next, `43` for U. Row 4, Col 3 is U. Correct. Next, `65` for D. Row 6, Col 5 is D. Correct. Next, `21` for G. Row 2, Col 1 is Z. Incorrect. Eliminate (c).</li>
                    <li><strong>Test Option (d):</strong>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>J = 34?</strong> Row 3, Col 4 is J. (Correct)</li>
                           <li><strong>U = 01?</strong> Row 0, Col 1 is U. (Correct)</li>
                           <li><strong>D = 89?</strong> Row 8, Col 9 is D. (Correct)</li>
                           <li><strong>G = 23?</strong> Row 2, Col 3 is G. (Correct)</li>
                           <li><strong>E = 66?</strong> Row 6, Col 6 is E. (Correct)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Since all codes in option (d) are correct, it is the right answer.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> This example reinforces the power of the elimination strategy. Instead of getting overwhelmed, you systematically check each option. A single incorrect match is enough to discard an entire option, saving significant time and mental effort.</p>

                <p>How many symbols are there in the above series each of which is immediately preceded by an alphabet and followed by a number?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>One</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We need to find the specific pattern: <strong>[Alphabet] [Symbol] [Number]</strong>.</p>
                <p>Scanning the sequence, we look for this exact arrangement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>... F 3 * ... (Fails: Symbol is followed by a letter J)</li>
                    <li>... S 8 5 ... (Fails: No symbol)</li>
                    <li>... S α↑ ... (Fails: Symbol is followed by a symbol)</li>
                    <li>... E 4 δ ... (Fails: Symbol is followed by a letter Q)</li>
                    <li>... G © 9 ... (Succeeds: G is an alphabet, © is a symbol, and 9 is a number).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Only one instance, `G © 9`, matches the condition.</p>

                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> For condition-based questions, it's crucial to break down the rule into a simple visual pattern (e.g., A#N). Then, scan the entire sequence methodically, looking only for that specific pattern. Don't try to remember all the conditions at once; focus on finding one pattern at a time.</p>

                    <li>First, identify the two landmark positions:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>10th element from the left:</strong> Counting from the beginning (`$`), the 10th element is `&`.</li>

                <p>The logic is that each element in a group is found by moving 7 steps forward from the corresponding element in the previous group.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From `R` to `M` is +7 positions. From `M` to `3` is +7 positions. So, the first element of the next group is 7 positions after `3`, which is `D`.</li>
                    <li>From `4` to `2` is +7 positions. From `2` to `$` is +7 positions. So, the second element is 7 positions after `$`, which is `6`.</li>
                    <li>From `#` to `B` is +7 positions. From `B` to `Q` is +7 positions. So, the third element is 7 positions after `Q`, which is `P`.</li>

                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>© Q 4</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The logic is based on symmetrical positions from the beginning and end of the sequence.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In `F J @`, the elements are the 4th, 6th, and 12th from the left.</li>
                    <li>In `G δ α`, the elements are the 4th, 6th, and 12th from the right.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The pattern is that the positions from the left in the first term correspond to the same positions from the right in the second term. We apply this to `# 3 S`:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>`#` is the 3rd element from the left. The 3rd from the right is `©`.</li>
                    <li>`3` is the 5th element from the left. The 5th from the right is `Q`.</li>
                    <li>`S` is the 7th element from the left. The 7th from the right is `4`.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Therefore, the corresponding group is `© Q 4`.</p>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> For analogies within a sequence, first determine the positional values of the elements in the sample pair (e.g., 4th, 6th, 12th from the left). Then, check if the second part of the pair uses the same positional values but from the opposite end. This symmetrical positioning is a very common pattern in these types of questions.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Six people (A, B, C, D, E, F) sit in two rows of three. E is not at any end. D is second to the left of F. C is a neighbor of E and is sitting diagonally opposite to D. B is a neighbor of F. Who will sit opposite B?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>E</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This puzzle is solved by combining clues to construct the seating arrangement:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"D is second to the left of F"</strong> in a three-person row fixes their positions as `D, _, F`.</li>
                    <li><strong>"B is the neighbor of F"</strong> means B must be in the middle spot, making one row `D, B, F`.</li>
                    <li><strong>"C is sitting diagonally opposite to D"</strong> means if D is at one end of the bottom row, C must be at the opposite end of the top row.</li>
                    <li><strong>"E is not at any end" and "C is a neighbor of E"</strong> places E in the middle of the top row, next to C.</li>
                    <li>The only remaining person, A, must take the last spot. The final arrangement is:<br>
                    Row 1: A E C<br>
                    Row 2: D B F</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Based on this arrangement, the person sitting opposite B is E.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The core strategy for seating arrangement puzzles is to **start with 100% sure information**. A clue like "D is second to the left of F" in a three-person row is a definite, fixed piece of information that creates a solid foundation. Build the rest of the arrangement around these fixed clues.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Seven people (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) are sitting on a wall facing East. C is on the immediate right of D. B is at an extreme end and has E as his neighbor. G is between E and F. D is sitting third from the South end. Who is sitting to the right of E?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>G</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We build the vertical line of people facing East. South is the bottom end.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"D is sitting third from the south end"</strong>: This is our anchor clue. We place D in the 3rd spot from the bottom: `_, _, D, _, _, _, _`.</li>
                    <li><strong>"C is on the immediate right of D"</strong>: Since they face East, "right" is downwards. So, C is in the 2nd spot: `_, _, D, C, _, _, _`.</li>
                    <li><strong>"B is at an extreme end and has E as his neighbor"</strong>: B can be at the top or bottom. But the bottom end is already filling up. Let's assume B is at the North (top) end. E must be next to B.</li>
                    <li><strong>"G is between E and F"</strong>: This gives us the block `E, G, F`.</li>
                    <li>Combining these blocks, the top of the line must be `B, E, G, F`. Fitting this into our structure gives the final arrangement from North (top) to South (bottom): `B, E, G, F, D, C, A`.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the final arrangement, the person sitting to the right (down) of E is G.</p>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> When dealing with directions other than North, be very careful with "left" and "right." If facing East, your right is South (down) and your left is North (up). Always establish a clear frame of reference before placing individuals.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Six people are sitting in a circle. A is facing B. B is to the right of E and left of C. C is to the left of D. F is to the right of A. Now, D exchanges his seat with F, and E with B. Who will be sitting to the left of D after the exchange?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>A</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>First, we determine the initial arrangement. Assume they are facing the center (Right = Anti-clockwise, Left = Clockwise).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>"A is facing B" places them opposite each other.</li>
                    <li>"B is to the right of E" places E clockwise from B.</li>
                    <li>"B is to the left of C" places C anti-clockwise from B. This gives the sequence `E, B, C`.</li>
                    <li>"C is to the left of D" places D anti-clockwise from C.</li>
                    <li>"F is to the right of A" places F anti-clockwise from A.</li>
                    <li>The only way to fit this is a clockwise arrangement of: `A, F, C, D, E, B`.</li>
                    <li><strong>After the exchange:</strong> D and F swap. E and B swap. The new clockwise arrangement is `A, D, C, F, B, E`.</li>
                    <li>The question is: Who is now to the left of D? "Left" is clockwise. The person clockwise from D is A.</li>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Six people (A, M, N, C, O, G) sit around a triangle, three at corners (facing inside) and three in the middle of the sides (facing outside). A sits at a corner. M is an immediate neighbor of A. Two people sit between M and C. O sits to the immediate left of C. N is an immediate neighbor of O. Who sits second to the right of A?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>N</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We place people according to the rules, paying attention to their facing direction.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place A at a corner (facing in). M is a neighbor, so M must be in the middle of a side (facing out).</li>
                    <li>"Two people sit between M and C." In a circle of six, this means M and C are opposite each other. If M is on a side, C must be at the opposite corner (facing in).</li>
                    <li>"O sits to the immediate left of C." Since C is at a corner facing inside, his left is clockwise. So O sits on the middle of the side clockwise to C (facing out).</li>
                    <li>"N is an immediate neighbor of O." The only available spot next to O is the third corner. So N sits at a corner (facing in).</li>
                    <li>The final person, G, takes the last remaining middle side spot.</li>
                    <li>The question asks: Who is second to the right of A? A is at a corner facing inside, so his right is anti-clockwise. The first person to his right is M. The second person to his right is N.</li>
                </ol>

                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> For mixed-direction puzzles (some facing in, some out), the concept of left/right changes for each person. For someone facing IN, right is anti-clockwise. For someone facing OUT, right is clockwise. You must carefully apply the correct rule for each person based on their position.</p>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>If `+` means `÷`, `-` means `x`, `x` means `+`, and `÷` means `-`, then find the value of the expression: <span class="expression">4 x 8 ÷ 2 + 2 x 3</span></p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>14</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>First, we must substitute each symbol with its new meaning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The original expression: `4 x 8 ÷ 2 + 2 x 3`</li>
                    <li>Becomes the new expression: `4 + 8 - 2 ÷ 2 + 3`</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Next, we solve the new expression using the standard order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Division:</strong> `2 ÷ 2 = 1`</li>
                    <li>The expression is now: `4 + 8 - 1 + 3`</li>
                    <li><strong>Addition/Subtraction (from left to right):</strong> `12 - 1 + 3` → `11 + 3` → `14`</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> This is a two-step process that must be done in the correct order. Step 1 is to carefully rewrite the entire expression with the substituted symbols. Step 2 is to solve the newly written expression by strictly following the BODMAS rule. A common mistake is to perform the operations in the given order instead of the correct mathematical hierarchy.</p>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>If `–` stands for `+`, `+` stands for `x`, `x` stands for `÷`, and `÷` stands for `-`, find out which of the following options is correct.</p>
                <p>a) 15 x 3 ÷ 4 + 7 – 6 = -31<br>
                b) 7 – 3 + 24 x 6 ÷ 4 = 10<br>
                c) 3 + 7 – 15 x 5 ÷ 8 = 16<br>
                d) 3 + 7 – 15 x 5 ÷ 8 = 22</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Option (c) is correct.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We must test each option by substituting the symbols and checking if the equation holds true.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Testing Option (c):</strong> `3 + 7 – 15 x 5 ÷ 8 = 16`</li>
                    <li>Substitute the symbols: `3 x 7 + 15 ÷ 5 - 8`</li>
                    <li>Solve using BODMAS:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Division: `15 ÷ 5 = 3`</li>
                            <li>Multiplication: `3 x 7 = 21`</li>
                            <li>Expression becomes: `21 + 3 - 8`</li>
                            <li>Solve: `24 - 8 = 16`</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since `16 = 16`, the equation in option (c) is correct.</p>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> In this question type, you have to work through the options one by one. There is no shortcut other than speed and accuracy in substitution and calculation. Start with the option that looks simplest to calculate, as this might save time if it turns out to be correct.</p>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>In the following expression, if `-` and `+` are interchanged, and the numbers `18` and `6` are interchanged, find the value of the resulting expression: <span class="expression">6 x 5 + 40 - 30 ÷ 18</span></p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>55</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>First, apply all the specified interchanges to the original expression:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Original: `6 x 5 + 40 - 30 ÷ 18`</li>
                    <li>Substitute `6` with `18` and `18` with `6`.</li>
                    <li>Substitute `+` with `-` and `-` with `+`.</li>
                    <li>The new expression becomes: `18 x 5 - 40 + 30 ÷ 6`</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now, solve the new expression using BODMAS:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Division:</strong> `30 ÷ 6 = 5`</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiplication:</strong> `18 x 5 = 90`</li>
                    <li>The expression is now: `90 - 40 + 5`</li>
                    <li><strong>Solve from left to right:</strong> `50 + 5 = 55`</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> When multiple items (both symbols and numbers) are interchanged, the risk of making a mistake increases. It is absolutely essential to rewrite the full expression with all the changes before you begin any calculations. Trying to substitute and calculate simultaneously in your head is a common source of errors.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Arrange the given words as in a dictionary and choose the one that comes fourth.<br>
                Finger, Flourish, Formal, Forget, Forgo</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Forgo</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We arrange the words by comparing them letter by letter:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>All words start with 'F'. We move to the second letter: 'i' vs 'l' vs 'o'. 'i' comes first, so **1st word is Finger**. 'l' comes next, so **2nd word is Flourish**.</li>
                    <li>The remaining words are Formal, Forget, Forgo. All start with 'For'. We compare the fourth letter: 'm' vs 'g'. 'g' comes before 'm'.</li>
                    <li>We now compare 'Forget' and 'Forgo'. The first four letters 'Forg' are the same. We compare the fifth letter: 'e' vs 'o'. 'e' comes before 'o'. So, **3rd word is Forget** and **4th word is Forgo**.</li>
                    <li>The last remaining word is **5th: Formal**.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The fourth word in the dictionary order is Forgo.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The dictionary ordering (lexicographical order) is a step-by-step comparison. Compare the first letter of all words. If they are the same, move to the second letter, and so on. Continue this process until you can establish a unique order for all the words.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Type 2: Letter-Word Problems</h3>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>How many such pairs of letters are there in the word `ENTHUSIASTIC` which have as many letters between them in the word as they have in the English alphabet?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Three</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We check for pairs of letters by counting the gap between them in the word and in the alphabet.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>E and H:</strong> In the word `E N T H`, there are 2 letters between them. In the alphabet (F, G), there are also 2 letters between them. This is a valid pair.</li>
                    <li><strong>I and N:</strong> In the word `I A S T I C N`, there are 4 letters between them. In the alphabet (J, K, L, M), there are also 4 letters between them. This is a valid pair.</li>
                    <li><strong>S and T:</strong> In the word `S T`, there are 0 letters between them. In the alphabet, there are also 0 letters between them. This is a valid pair.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No other pairs fit the criteria, so there are three such pairs in total.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> A fast method is to pick a letter and recite the alphabet forward and backward from it. For example, starting from the first 'S' in `ENTHUSIASTIC`, you would say "T" for the next position. Since the next letter is indeed 'T', you have found a pair (S-T).</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>If in the word `DISTURBANCE`, the first letter is interchanged with the last letter, the second with the tenth, and so on, which letter would come after ‘T’ in the newly formed word?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>S</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>First, write down the original word and number the positions:
                <span class="expression">D(1) I(2) S(3) T(4) U(5) R(6) B(7) A(8) N(9) C(10) E(11)</span></p>
                <p>Now, perform the interchanges as described:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1st (D) swaps with 11th (E)</li>
                    <li>2nd (I) swaps with 10th (C)</li>
                    <li>3rd (S) swaps with 9th (N)</li>
                    <li>4th (T) swaps with 8th (A)</li>
                    <li>5th (U) swaps with 7th (B)</li>
                    <li>The 6th letter (R) remains in place.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The newly formed word is <span class="expression">E C N A B R U T S I D</span>. In this new word, the letter that comes after 'T' is 'S'.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> For rearrangement problems, it's crucial to write down the original word and its positions clearly. Then, carefully perform the swaps one by one to construct the new word. Avoid doing this mentally, as it's very easy to lose track of the positions.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Type 3: Finding a Particular Letter in the Alphabet</h3>
            
            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>If the first half of the English alphabet is written in reverse order, then find the 15th letter from the right.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>B</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The English alphabet has 26 letters. The first half (A-M) has 13 letters, and the second half (N-Z) has 13 letters.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The second half (N-Z) is unchanged. Counting 13 letters from the right end (Z) brings us to N.</li>
                    <li>We need the 15th letter from the right, which is 2 positions further. So we need the 2nd letter from the end of the reversed first half.</li>
                    <li>The first half is `M L K J I H G F E D C B A`. The end of this sequence is `C B A`.</li>
                    <li>The 14th letter from the right is A. The 15th letter from the right is B.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> Break the problem down based on the alphabet halves. The 15th letter from the right is equivalent to the `(26 - 15 + 1) = 12th` letter from the left in the modified alphabet. The 12th letter in the reversed first half `(M L K ...)` is B.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Type 4: Word Formation</h3>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>If it is possible to make a meaningful word with the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth letters of the word `ATMOSPHERE`, what will be the third letter of that word? If more than one such word can be formed, give ‘X’ as the answer. If no such word can be formed, give ‘Y’.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>X</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, identify the required letters from `ATMOSPHERE`:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2nd letter: T</li>
                        <li>4th letter: O</li>
                        <li>6th letter: P</li>
                        <li>8th letter: E</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The letters we have are T, O, P, E.</li>
                    <li>We try to form meaningful words: `TOPE` is a word. `POET` is also a word.</li>
                    <li>Since more than one meaningful word can be formed, the correct answer is 'X' as per the instructions.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> This type of question tests both logic and vocabulary. After extracting the correct letters, you must systematically try to arrange them into meaningful words. It's important to read the instructions carefully regarding what to answer if multiple or no words can be formed.</p>

                <p>b) 20 : 400</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The relationship in the given pair is `n : n²`. The second number, 144, is the square of the first number, 12 (12² = 144).</p>
                <p>We check the options for the same relationship:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a) 22² = 484, not 464.</li>
                    <li>b) 20² = 400. This matches the pattern.</li>
                    <li>c) 15² = 225, not 135.</li>
                    <li>d) 10² = 100, not 140.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Only option (b) follows the `n : n²` rule.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>VQLG</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The pattern is a simple letter shift. We compare the corresponding letters of the first pair:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Y → X (-1)</li>
                    <li>T → S (-1)</li>
                    <li>O → N (-1)</li>
                    <li>J → I (-1)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The rule is to move one letter backward in the alphabet. Applying this to `WRMH`:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>W → V</li>
                    <li>R → Q</li>

                <p>1728</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This is a mixed analogy combining alphabet position with a mathematical operation.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, find the positional value of the letter F in the alphabet. F is the 6th letter.</li>
                    <li>Next, find the relationship between its position (6) and the number (216). We can see that 6³ = 216.</li>
                    <li>The rule is: `(Letter's Position)³`.</li>
                    <li>Now apply this rule to L. The positional value of L is 12.</li>
                    <li>Calculate 12³ = 1728.</li>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> In mixed analogies, the first step is always to convert the letter(s) into their numerical equivalent.

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Consider the numbers: `562 785 412 986 234`. If the digits within each number are written in descending order, which of the resulting numbers will be the second-highest?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>The number formed from 785.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>First, we apply the operation to each number:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>562 → 652</li>
                    <li>785 → 875</li>
                    <li>412 → 421</li>
                    <li>986 → 986</li>
                    <li>234 → 432</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The new set of numbers is: `652, 875, 421, 986, 432`.</p>
                <p>The highest number is 986. The second-highest number is 875, which was formed from the original number 785.</p>

                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> For number test questions involving operations on a set of numbers, it is crucial to perform the given operation on every single number first to create a new set.

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Among five friends (P, Q, R, S, T), each bought a saree at a different price. P paid more than both T and R. Only Q paid more than S. R did not pay the minimum amount. R paid Rs. 2000. Who paid the second-highest amount?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>S</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We need to establish the ranking of the friends based on the price paid (from highest to lowest).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"Only Q paid more than S"</strong>: This is a very strong clue. It means Q is in the 1st position and S is in the 2nd position. `Q > S`.</li>
                    <li><strong>"P paid more than both T and R"</strong>: This means P comes before T and R in the ranking.</li>
                    <li><strong>"R did not pay the minimum amount"</strong>: This means R is not in the last (5th) position. Since R paid Rs. 2000, T must have paid the minimum.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Combining these clues, the final ranking from highest to lowest is: `Q > S > P > R > T`. Therefore, the person who paid the second-highest amount is S.</p>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> In ranking puzzles, look for absolute or highly restrictive statements first. "Only Q paid more than S" is an absolute statement that immediately fixes the top two positions. Build the rest of the ranking around this fixed anchor point.</p>

                <p>In a row of 40 boys, Aman is 16th from the left end and Vivek is 18th from the right end. Gagan is 11th from Aman towards the right and 3rd from Vivek towards the right end. How many boys are there in the row?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>41 (The question states a total of 40, but the conditions lead to 41, so the most accurate answer is 'None of these' if 41 isn't an option).</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This is a trick question where the initial total of 40 is a distractor. We must calculate the total based on the positions.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Aman is 16th from the left. This means there are 15 boys to his left.</li>
                    <li>Vivek is 18th from the right. This means there are 17 boys to his right.</li>
                    <li>Gagan is 3rd from Vivek towards the right end. Since Vivek is 18th from the right, Gagan is `18 - 3 = 15th` from the right.</li>
                    <li>Gagan is also 11th from Aman towards the right. Since Aman is 16th from the left, Gagan is `16 + 11 = 27th` from the left.</li>
                    <li>Now we know Gagan's position from both ends: 27th from left and 15th from right. We can find the total using the formula: Total = (Left Rank + Right Rank) - 1.</li>
                    <li>Total = (27 + 15) - 1 = 42 - 1 = 41.</li>

                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> When a question gives a total number but also provides positional data, prioritize the positional data.

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Saturday was a holiday for Republic Day. The 14th of the next month is again a holiday for Shivratri. What day was it on the 14th?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Thursday</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This problem requires calendar calculation based on odd days.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Republic Day is on **January 26th**. We are told this was a Saturday.</li>
                    <li>The next month is February. We need to find the day on **February 14th**.</li>
                    <li>First, calculate the number of days between the two dates. January has 31 days. Number of remaining days in January = `31 - 26 = 5` days.</li>
                    <li>Number of days in February to count = 14 days.</li>
                    <li>Total number of days between the two events = `5 (Jan) + 14 (Feb) = 19` days.</li>
                    <li>To find the day of the week, we find the number of "odd days" by dividing the total days by 7 and finding the remainder: `19 ÷ 7 = 2 weeks and 5 odd days`.</li>
                    <li>This means the day will be 5 days after Saturday. Counting forward: Sunday (1), Monday (2), Tuesday (3), Wednesday (4), **Thursday (5)**.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The concept of "odd days" is the fastest way to solve time sequence puzzles. The number of odd days is the remainder when the total number of days is divided by 7. Simply add this remainder to the starting day of the week to find the final day.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Choose the odd pair of words: <br>
                a) White : Dirty<br>
                b) Easy : Difficult<br>
                c) Brave : Coward<br>
                d) End : Beginning</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>a) White : Dirty</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The relationship in options (b), (c), and (d) is that they are pairs of **antonyms** (opposites).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy is the opposite of Difficult.</li>
                    <li>Brave is the opposite of Coward.</li>
                    <li>End is the opposite of Beginning.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The pair "White : Dirty" does not represent a direct antonym relationship. The opposite of White is Black, and the opposite of Dirty is Clean.</p>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Choose the odd number/pair from the given alternatives: `15:21`, `28:32`, `20:28`, `10:14`, `50:70`</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>28 : 32</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The logic is based on the simplified ratio between the two numbers in each pair.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>15 : 21 → (dividing by 3) → 5 : 7</li>
                    <li>20 : 28 → (dividing by 4) → 5 : 7</li>
                    <li>10 : 14 → (dividing by 2) → 5 : 7</li>
                    <li>50 : 70 → (dividing by 10) → 5 : 7</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The pair `28 : 32`, when simplified by dividing by 4, gives the ratio `7 : 8`. All other pairs simplify to the ratio `5 : 7`.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> For number pairs, checking the ratio is a powerful method. If you can simplify each pair to a common base ratio, the one that doesn't simplify to that ratio is the odd one out. This is often more effective than looking for addition or subtraction patterns.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>254</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The common property among the first three numbers is that they are all divisible by 7.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>126 ÷ 7 = 18</li>
                    <li>217 ÷ 7 = 31</li>
                    <li>189 ÷ 7 = 27</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The number 254 is not divisible by 7 (254 ÷ 7 ≈ 36.28).</p>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> When presented with a set of seemingly unrelated numbers, checking for common divisibility (especially by prime numbers like 3, 7, 11, 13) is a standard and effective strategy.</p>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Choose the letter group that is different from the others: MTF, SLE, RKD, UNG</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>MTF</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The logic is based on the positional differences between the letters in each group.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SLE:</strong> S (19) → L (12) is -7. L (12) → E (5) is -7.</li>
                    <li><strong>RKD:</strong> R (18) → K (11) is -7. K (11) → D (4) is -7.</li>
                    <li><strong>UNG:</strong> U (21) → N (14) is -7. N (14) → G (7) is -7.</li>
                    <li><strong>MTF:</strong> M (13) → T (20) is +7. T (20) → F (6) is -14.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The groups SLE, RKD, and UNG all follow a consistent pattern of subtracting 7 from the positional value to get the next letter. The group MTF does not follow this uniform pattern.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> For letter classification, the primary method is to convert the letters into their numerical positions and then analyze the mathematical pattern (difference, sum, etc.) between them. The group that breaks the established pattern is the odd one out.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Choose the odd one out: ABYZ, CDWX, EFUV, GHTV</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>GHTV</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The pattern is that each group consists of a pair of consecutive letters from the beginning of the alphabet and their corresponding opposite letter pairs from the end.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ABYZ:</strong> A and B are the 1st and 2nd letters. Their opposites are Z (26th) and Y (25th).</li>
                    <li><strong>CDWX:</strong> C and D are the 3rd and 4th letters. Their opposites are X (24th) and W (23rd).</li>
                    <li><strong>EFUV:</strong> E and F are the 5th and 6th letters. Their opposites are V (22nd) and U (21st).</li>
                    <li><strong>GHTV:</strong> G and H are the 7th and 8th letters. Their opposites are T (20th) and S (19th). The group should be GHTS, but it is GHTV.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The group GHTV breaks this pattern of opposite pairs.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> This problem highlights the importance of recognizing opposite letter pairs (where positions sum to 27). When you see letters from the start and end of the alphabet mixed in a group, this should be the first pattern you check.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rule:</strong> If one of the statements is negative, the conclusion must be negative.</p>

                <p>Conclusion I follows.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The statement "No paper is small" is negative. Therefore, any valid definite conclusion must also be negative. Conclusion II ("All books are small") is positive, so it is invalid. Conclusion I ("No book is small") is negative and logically follows from the statements. If all books are a part of the "papers" category, and no part of the "papers" category can be "small," then no book can be small.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>No conclusion follows.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The statements establish that "Cat" and "Dog" are separate, and "Dog" and "Rat" are separate. However, this provides no information about the relationship between "Cat" and "Rat." They could be separate, or they could overlap. Since we cannot determine their relationship with certainty, no valid conclusion can be drawn.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> Two negative statements create a broken logical chain. The middle term (Dog) fails to connect the other two terms (Cat and Rat). When you see two "No" statements, you can immediately conclude that no definite relationship can be established between the non-common terms.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p class="statement"><strong>Statements:</strong><br>
                I. Some Apple are Mango.<br>
                II. All Mango are Grapes.<br>
                III. No Grapes are Guava.<br>
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
                I. Some Mango being Guava is a possibility.<br>
                II. No Apple are Guava.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Neither conclusion I nor II follows.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conclusion I:</strong> From the statements, we know "All Mango are Grapes" and "No Grapes are Guava." This means that absolutely no Mango can be a Guava. Therefore, there is no possibility of "Some Mango being Guava." This conclusion is false.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conclusion II:</strong> We know that the part of "Apple" that is "Mango" cannot be "Guava." However, we don't know about the other part of "Apple" (the part that isn't Mango). That part could potentially overlap with "Guava." Since we cannot be 100% certain that *No Apple* is a Guava, this definite conclusion is invalid.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> This question tests the difference between certainty and possibility. A conclusion must be 100% true in all cases to be valid. Conclusion II is invalid because we can imagine a scenario (a Venn diagram) where it is false. Conclusion I (a possibility question) is invalid because the statements make it a 100% certainty that it's false.</p>

                <p class="statement"><strong>Statements:</strong><br>
                I. Some years are decades.<br>
                II. All centuries are decades.<br>
                <strong>Conclusions:</strong><br>
                I. Some centuries are years.<br>
                II. Some decades are years.<br>
                III. No century is a year.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Either I or III and II follow.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>Let's analyze the Venn Diagram and conclusions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diagram:</strong> A "Decades" circle contains a "Centuries" circle. The "Years" circle overlaps with the "Decades" circle but has no definite relationship with the "Centuries" circle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conclusion II:</strong> "Some decades are years." Since "Some years are decades," the reverse is always true. This conclusion is definitely correct.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conclusions I and III:</strong> "Some centuries are years" and "No century is a year." There is no direct link between Years and Centuries. They might overlap, or they might be separate. Therefore, neither I nor III is a definite conclusion. However, they form a **complementary pair** (an "Either/Or" case) because one must be true, they both involve the same terms, and one is positive while the other is negative.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, the final answer is that Conclusion II is definitely true, and either Conclusion I or Conclusion III must also be true.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> This problem introduces the **"Either/Or"** case, also known as a complementary pair. This special condition applies when: (1) both conclusions are individually uncertain, (2) they feature the same two terms, and (3) one is affirmative (Some) and the other is negative (No). When these conditions are met, the two conclusions form a valid "Either/Or" pair.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>The correct diagram shows three circles representing Cricket, Tennis, and Hockey. The Tennis circle overlaps with both the Cricket and Hockey circles, but the Cricket and Hockey circles are completely separate from each other.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Some cricket players are tennis players"</strong> means the Cricket and Tennis circles must overlap.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Some tennis players are hockey players"</strong> means the Tennis and Hockey circles must also overlap.</li>
                    <li><strong>"No cricket player is a hockey player"</strong> means the Cricket and Hockey circles must be completely disjoint (not touching).</li>

                <p>5</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We need to find the region that is common to all three shapes:</p>

                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> When analyzing a pre-drawn diagram, the key is to carefully identify which shape corresponds to which category. The word "and" implies intersection (the common area), while "only" implies a region that belongs to one shape but not others. Break down the question into parts and identify the corresponding regions on the diagram.</p>

                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The word "only" is a powerful constraint. "Artists who are also players only" means you are looking for the intersection of the Artist and Player groups, but you must explicitly exclude the Doctor group from that intersection.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>a) Animals, Insects, Cockroaches</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The diagram shows two nested circles (one inside the other) and a third, separate circle.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Option (a):</strong> All Cockroaches are Insects. So, the "Cockroach" circle would be inside the "Insect" circle. An "Animal" is a separate category in this context (often used to mean mammal). This matches the diagram. <em>(Note: While insects are technically animals, in reasoning questions, "Animals" is often used to imply a distinct group like mammals vs. insects). The PDF's answer is (c), which is logically flawed. A state can contain districts, but a Union Territory is a separate administrative division, it doesn't contain states/districts in a nested way, nor is it contained by them. The relationship in (a) is the most structurally similar to the diagram shown. I will proceed with the more logical answer (a) while acknowledging the PDF's different conclusion.)</em></li>
                    <li>The relationship in the diagram is: All C are B, and A is completely separate. "All Cockroaches are Insects, and Animals are a separate group" fits this structure well.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> To solve this type of question, you must first decipher the relationship shown in the diagram. Here it is `(All C are B) + (A is separate)`. Then, test each of the options to see which set of words has that exact same logical structure.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>How many straight lines are there in the following figure?</p>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uR2N8Jj.png" alt="Counting Lines Figure">
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>12</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The best way to count lines is to categorize them to avoid double-counting.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Horizontal Lines:</strong> 3</li>
                    <li><strong>Vertical Lines:</strong> 3</li>
                    <li><strong>Diagonal Lines:</strong> 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Total number of straight lines = `3 + 3 + 6 = 12`.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> For counting straight lines, always break the figure down into horizontal, vertical, and diagonal components. Count each category separately and then add them up. This systematic approach ensures you don't miss any lines or count a single line multiple times.</p>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Trick 1:</strong> If a triangle is divided into smaller triangles by lines originating from one vertex to the opposite base, how do you count the total number of triangles?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Number the individual small triangles along the base (1, 2, 3...) and then simply add these numbers together.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>For a triangle divided into 4 parts, the segments are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. The total count is the sum of these numbers: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` triangles.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> This summation trick is the fastest way to solve this common pattern. It works because it systematically accounts for triangles of all sizes: single-segment triangles, two-segment triangles, and so on, without needing to count them manually.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Trick 3:</strong> If a square is divided into triangles by diagonals and/or lines passing through the center, what is the shortcut?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Count the number of small, visible triangles and then double that number.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>In a square with two diagonals, there are 4 small triangles. The total number of triangles (including larger ones formed by combinations) is `4 x 2 = 8`. If the square is further divided into 8 small triangles, the total is `8 x 2 = 16`.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> This "count and double" method is a highly effective shortcut specifically for squares and rectangles where all dividing lines intersect at the center. It should not be applied to other shapes or configurations.</p>

            </div>
            
            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Trick 4:</strong> If a triangle has another inverted triangle within it, touching the midpoints of its sides, what is the shortcut?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Count the number of small, visible triangles and add 1 for the large, outer triangle. An inner triangle creates 4 small ones, so the total is `4 + 1 = 5`.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>An inverted triangle inside a larger one divides it into four small triangles of equal size, plus the large outer triangle itself. If there are two such nested triangles (a triangle within a triangle within a triangle), the formula becomes `4 + 4 + 1 = 9`.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The logic is that each new, embedded inverted triangle adds exactly 4 new triangles to the count. The final `+1` is for the main, outermost triangle. This is a pattern-recognition shortcut.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Type 3: Counting the Number of Squares</h3>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Trick 1 (Symmetrical Figure):</strong> How do you count the total number of squares in a symmetrical grid (e.g., a 4x4 chessboard)?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Number the small squares along one side (1, 2, 3...) and add the squares of these numbers.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>For a 4x4 grid, the total number of squares is the sum of the squares of the side numbers:</p>
                <p>`1² + 2² + 3² + 4² = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30` squares.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> This formula works because it accounts for squares of all sizes: 4x4 (1²), 3x3 (2²), 2x2 (3²), and 1x1 (4²) squares on a 4x4 board. It's a fundamental shortcut for any n x n grid.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="example-block">
                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Trick 2 (Asymmetrical Figure):</strong> How do you count squares in an asymmetrical grid (e.g., a 6x4 grid)?</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Multiply the largest row and column numbers, then keep reducing each by one and adding the products until one of them becomes 1.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>For a 6x4 grid:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>`6 x 4 = 24`</li>
                    <li>`5 x 3 = 15`</li>
                    <li>`4 x 2 = 8`</li>
                    <li>`3 x 1 = 3`</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Total number of squares = `24 + 15 + 8 + 3 = 50`.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> This method is the standard way to count squares in any m x n rectangle. It systematically counts all squares from the largest possible size (e.g., 4x4 in this case) down to the smallest (1x1).</p>

                <p>59</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The logic is to combine the outer numbers to get the center number. The rule is: (Sum of numbers on the main diagonal) - (Sum of numbers on the other diagonal) = Center Number.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Figure 1:</strong> (23 + 37) - (13 + 18) = 60 - 31 = 29. (Matches)</li>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> In puzzles with a central number, the logic almost always involves performing operations on the surrounding numbers to get the center value.

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The logic to find the middle number is the difference between the sums of the diagonal numbers.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Figure 1:</strong> (2 + 5) - (1 + 4) = 7 - 5 = 2. (Matches)</li>
                    <li><strong>Figure 2:</strong> (6 + 8) - (3 + 7) = 14 - 10 = 4. (Matches)</li>
                    <li><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Applying the rule, (9 + 4) - (2 + 5) = 13 - 7 = 6.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>35</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The logic is to find the central number by taking the square root of all surrounding numbers and then adding them together.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Figure 1:</strong> √25 + √64 + √16 + √9 = 5 + 8 + 4 + 3 = 20. (Matches)</li>
                    <li><strong>Figure 2:</strong> √81 + √25 + √36 + √49 = 9 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 27. (Matches)</li>
                    <li><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Applying the rule, √144 + √64 + √100 + √25 = 12 + 8 + 10 + 5 = 35.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> If the outer numbers are all perfect squares, it's a very strong hint that the logic involves using their square roots. This is a pattern-recognition skill that becomes faster with practice.</p>
