            <h2>1. Theory: About Data Interpretation</h2>
            <p><strong>Data Interpretation (DI)</strong> is the process of making sense of numerical data that has been collected, analyzed, and presented in a visual format. In the context of competitive exams, DI is a critical section that tests a candidate's ability to read, understand, analyze, and interpret data presented in tables, graphs, and charts. It is a test of your calculation speed, analytical skills, and logical reasoning.</p>

            <h3>Core Techniques & Skills Required</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speed Maths:</strong> Fast calculation of percentages, averages, and ratios is essential. Practice approximation techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Scanning:</strong> Quickly locate the relevant data from the chart or table without getting overwhelmed by extra information.</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding the Question:</strong> Carefully read what is being asked. Is it a percentage increase, a ratio, an average, or a simple value? The wording is key.</li>
                <li><strong>Approximation:</strong> In many cases, you don't need the exact answer. Approximating values can save a lot of time, especially with complex numbers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of DI Questions in Indian Government Exams</h3>
            <p>The data can be presented in various formats. The most common ones are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Tabular DI:</strong> Data is presented in rows and columns. This is the most basic and common format.</li>
                <li><strong>Bar Graphs:</strong> Data is represented using rectangular bars. They are excellent for comparing quantities across different categories.</li>
                <li><strong>Line Graphs:</strong> Data is plotted as a series of points connected by lines. They are ideal for showing trends over a period of time.</li>
                <li><strong>Pie Charts:</strong> Data is shown as a circular chart divided into sectors, representing proportions or percentages of a whole.</li>
                <li><strong>Caselets:</strong> Data is presented in the form of a paragraph or a passage. Your first step is to read the passage carefully and convert the information into a structured table or chart.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixed DI:</strong> A combination of two or more data formats (e.g., a table with a pie chart) is used to present the information.</li>
            </ol>

                                <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Use the percentage formula: <code>(Part / Whole) * 100</code>.</p>
                                <p>Number of students passed from Kolkata = 28,000.</p>
                                <p>Number of students appeared from Kolkata = 38,000.</p>
                                <p>Pass Percentage = (Passed / Appeared) * 100</p>
                                <p>Pass Percentage = (28 / 38) * 100 = (14 / 19) * 100</p>
                                <p>Calculation: <code>1400 / 19 ≈ 73.68%</code>, which is approximately <strong>73.7%</strong>.</p>

                                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) 20.1%</p>
                                <h4>Explanation</h4>
                                <p><strong>Technique:</strong> First, sum the required columns, then apply the percentage formula.</p>
                                <p>Number of students passed from Pune = 45,000.</p>
                                <p>Total number of students appeared from all cities = 45 + 52 + 38 + 48 + 55 = 238 thousand = 238,000.</p>
                                <p>Required Percentage = (Passed from Pune / Total Appeared) * 100</p>
                                <p>Required Percentage = (45 / 238) * 100</p>
                                <p>Approximation: This is slightly less than 45/225, which is 1/5 or 20%. Let's calculate: <code>4500 / 238 ≈ 18.9%</code>. Let me re-calculate the sum. 45+52=97. 97+38=135. 135+48=183. 183+55=238. Correct.
                                4500/238. 238 * 2 = 476. So it's less than 20%. 238*1 = 238. 450-238 = 212. Bring down 0. 2120. 238*9 = 2142. So 18.9%.
                                My answer is 18.9%. Let me re-check the question and options.
                                Perhaps I made an error in the sum. Let's try again. 40+50+30+40+50 = 210. 5+2+8+8+5=28. 210+28=238. The sum is correct.
                                There might be a typo in the question's values or options. Let me adjust the values to make one option correct.
                                Let's make the number of passed students from Pune 48,000.
                                Then (48 / 238) * 100 ≈ 20.16%. This matches option C.
                                I will adjust the table for this set.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>(Note: Table value for Pune (Passed) has been adjusted to 48 for question consistency)</strong></p>
                                <p>Passed from Pune = 48,000. Total Appeared = 238,000.
                                <br>Percentage = <code>(48 / 238) * 100 ≈ 20.16%</code>, which is <strong>20.1%</strong>.</p>

<br>Total production of Company Z in 2020 & 2021 = 55 + 70 = 125 thousand.
<br>Ratio = 70 : 125.
<br>Simplifying by dividing by 5: <strong>14 : 25</strong>.
Let me check the answer. 7:13. To get this, Z's production would need to be 130. 55+75 maybe? Let me adjust Z in 2021 to 75. Then sum is 130. Ratio is 70:130 = 7:13.

<br>Total production of Z = 50 + 60 + 55 + 75 + 65 = 305 thousand (using adjusted value).
<br>Percentage = (250 / 305) * 100 = (50 / 61) * 100.
<br>Calculation: 5000 / 61 ≈ <strong>81.9%</strong>. Let me recheck.
Total Y = 250. Total Z = 305.
250/305 * 100 = 81.9%. Let me adjust Z's 2022 to 55. Then total Z = 50+60+55+75+55 = 295.

Let me adjust Y's 2022 to 65. Total Y = 255. Total Z = 305.
255/305 * 100 = 83.6%.
This requires significant data manipulation. I'll stick to the original values (Z in 2021 is 70) and calculate the right answer.
<br>Total Y = 250. Total Z (original) = 50+60+55+70+65 = 300.
