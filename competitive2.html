                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> RC tests your ability to read, understand, and analyze a given passage. Strategy is as important as reading speed.
                </div>
                <h3>Key Strategies & Solved Example</h3>
                <ul class="strategy-list">
                    <li><strong>1. Skim the Passage First:</strong> Quickly read the first and last paragraphs, and the first sentence of other paragraphs to get the main idea and tone.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Read the Questions Next:</strong> Read the questions (but not the options) before reading the passage in detail. This helps you know what to look for.</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Active Reading:</strong> Read the passage carefully now, underlining keywords and making mental notes related to the questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>4. Identify Question Types:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Main Idea/Title:</strong> Asks for the central theme. The answer is usually in the first or last paragraph.</li>
                            <li><strong>Direct Questions:</strong> The answer is explicitly stated in the passage. Find the keyword in the passage to locate it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inference Questions:</strong> The answer is not directly stated but is strongly implied. Look for clues and draw a logical conclusion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vocabulary Questions:</strong> Asks for the meaning of a word in the context of the passage.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>5. Elimination Technique:</strong> For multiple-choice questions, eliminate the options that are clearly wrong, too extreme, or not mentioned in the passage.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <strong>Solved Example:</strong><br>
                    <em>Passage:</em> The greatest challenge of the 21st century is climate change. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures. This phenomenon, known as global warming, has far-reaching effects, including rising sea levels and more extreme weather events. While renewable energy sources like solar and wind are promising alternatives, their widespread adoption faces significant economic and political hurdles.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Q: The primary purpose of the passage is to...</strong><br>
                    (A) advocate for renewable energy.<br>
                    (B) describe the effects of global warming.<br>
                    (C) outline the main aspects of climate change.<br>
                    (D) criticize the use of fossil fuels.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong> Option (C) is the best answer. The passage introduces climate change as the main challenge (sentence 1), explains its cause (fossil fuels), its mechanism (global warming), its effects (rising sea levels), and the challenges to its solution (renewable energy hurdles). It covers all these aspects, making it a general outline. The other options are too specific or not the main focus.

                <h3>Key Strategies & Solved Example</h3>
                <ul class="strategy-list">
                    <li><strong>1. Find the Opening Sentence:</strong> Look for a sentence that introduces a person, concept, or topic. It is usually a general statement and will not start with pronouns like 'he', 'it', 'they' or conjunctions like 'but', 'so'.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Identify Mandatory Pairs:</strong> Look for sentences that have a clear connection.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pronoun-Antecedent:</strong> A sentence with a pronoun (e.g., 'he', 'its') must follow the sentence that introduces the noun it refers to.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cause and Effect:</strong> A sentence describing a cause will come before the sentence describing its effect.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronological Order:</strong> Arrange events in the order they happened.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>3. Find the Concluding Sentence:</strong> Look for a sentence that summarizes the paragraph or provides a final thought. It often starts with words like 'Thus', 'Therefore', 'Hence'.</li>
                    <li><strong>4. Use the Options (if available):</strong> Check the given options to see which sequence makes the most logical sense.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="explanation">
                    <strong>Solved Example:</strong><br>
                    A. He was a great leader who was loved by his people.<br>
                    B. This kingdom was located in the fertile plains of the north.<br>
                    C. Ashoka was one of the greatest emperors of India.<br>
                    D. There was once a vast kingdom known as Magadha.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Correct Sequence: DBCA</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
                    1. <strong>D</strong> is the best opening sentence as it introduces the broad topic of a kingdom, 'Magadha'.<br>
                    2. <strong>B</strong> logically follows D because 'This kingdom' directly refers to 'Magadha' mentioned in D. So, DB is a mandatory pair.<br>
                    3. <strong>C</strong> introduces the specific character, 'Ashoka'. While it's a good introductory sentence, it's more specific than D. It fits well after the general setting has been established.<br>
                    4. <strong>A</strong> must follow C because the pronoun 'He' clearly refers to 'Ashoka' introduced in C. So, CA is a mandatory pair.
                    5. Combining the pairs gives us the logical flow: General setting (DB) -> Specific character (C) -> Detail about the character (A). The correct sequence is DBCA.

                <ul class="strategy-list">
                    <li><strong>1. Read the Entire Passage First:</strong> Get an overall idea of the passage's topic, tone (positive, negative, neutral), and tense (past, present, future).</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Focus on Context:</strong> Read the sentence before and after the blank to understand the context. The correct word must fit logically and grammatically.</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Use Grammar Rules:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check for **Subject-Verb Agreement**.</li>
                            <li>Look for the correct **preposition** or **conjunction** that fits the context.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>4. Use Vocabulary & Collocation:</strong> Some blanks test vocabulary. Choose the word with the most appropriate meaning. Look for collocations (words that are often used together, like 'heavy rain').</li>
                    <li><strong>5. Eliminate Wrong Options:</strong> If you are unsure, eliminate the options that are grammatically incorrect or do not fit the context.</li>

                    <strong>Solved Example:</strong><br>
                    The rise of artificial intelligence is one of the most significant developments of our time. It has the __(1)__ to revolutionize industries from healthcare to transportation. However, many experts are __(2)__ about its potential risks.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Q1.</strong> (A) potent (B) ability (C) potential (D) power<br>
                    <strong>Q2.</strong> (A) concerned (B) happy (C) careless (D) excited
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
                    1. For blank (1), the sentence structure "has the ___ to" requires a noun. 'Potential' means the capacity to develop into something in the future, which fits the context of revolutionizing industries perfectly. So, <strong>(C) potential</strong> is the correct answer. 'Potent' is an adjective, 'ability' is usually followed by 'to do', and 'power' is less specific here.
                    <br>
                    2. For blank (2), the word 'However' indicates a contrast. The first sentence is positive ('revolutionize'), so the second sentence must express a contrasting, negative idea. The word 'risks' confirms this. 'Concerned' means worried, which fits perfectly. So, <strong>(A) concerned</strong> is the correct answer.
