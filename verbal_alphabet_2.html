            <h3>Theory</h3>
            <div class="theory">
                <p>Alphabet analogy problems require you to identify the relationship between the first pair of letter groups and apply the same relationship to the second pair to find the missing group.</p>

Pattern Analysis for BC : DE
B -> C (+1, consecutive)
D -> E (+1, consecutive)

Relationship between pairs:
The second pair (DE) starts with the letter immediately following the last letter of the first pair (C -> D).

Applying the pattern to EF : ?
E -> F (+1, consecutive)
The answer must start with the letter immediately following F, which is G.
The answer must be a consecutive pair.
Result: G -> H (+1)
</div>

            <h3>Answer</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>A) GH</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <div class="explanation">
                <ol>
                    <li>The relationship between B and C is that they are consecutive letters.</li>
                    <li>Similarly, D and E are consecutive letters.</li>
                    <li>The connection between the two pairs is that 'D' comes immediately after 'C'.</li>
                    <li>Following this logic, the missing pair must come immediately after 'F'. The letter after 'F' is 'G'.</li>
                    <li>Since the pair must be consecutive letters, the answer is GH.</li>

            <h3>Additional Remarks</h3>
            <div class="remarks">
                <p>This is the most basic type of alphabet analogy, focusing on direct succession. Always check for simple consecutive patterns first.</p>

            <div class="theory">
                <p>This type of analogy involves two layers of logic: the "internal pattern" (the gap between letters within a group) and the "external pattern" (the relationship between the groups themselves).</p>

Internal Pattern Analysis:
C (+2) -> E (+2) -> G   (Skip one letter)
H (+2) -> J (+2) -> L   (Skip one letter)

External Pattern Analysis (Relationship between pairs):
The second group (HJL) starts with H, which is the letter immediately after G from the first group.
G -> H (+1)

Applying to IKM : ?
The answer must start with the letter after M, which is N.
The answer must follow the internal (+2) pattern.

            <h3>Answer</h3>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>C) NPR</strong></p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <div class="explanation">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Internal Logic:</strong> In CEG, each letter is separated by one skipped letter (C, skip D, E, skip F, G). This is a "+2" jump pattern. The same applies to HJL and IKM.</li>
                    <li><strong>External Logic:</strong> The first letter of the second group (H) is the very next letter after the last letter of the first group (G).</li>
                    <li><strong>Application:</strong> The last letter of IKM is M. The next letter is N. Therefore, our answer must start with N.</li>
                    <li>Applying the internal "+2" pattern to N gives us: N, skip O, P, skip Q, R. The result is NPR.</li>

            <h3>Additional Remarks</h3>
            <div class="remarks">
                <p>Always dissect the problem into its internal and external logic. Solving them separately simplifies complex-looking questions.</p>

            <h3>Theory</h3>
            <div class="theory">
                <p>In this pattern, a different operation or "shift" is applied to each corresponding letter in the pair. The key is to find the pattern in the shifts themselves (e.g., +1, +2, +3 or +1, +3, +5).</p>

Applying this shift pattern to BIG:
B (+1) -> C
I (+3) -> L  (I is 9th letter, 9+3=12, L is 12th)

                <ol>
                    <li>Compare the first letters: C becomes D, which is a shift of +1 position.</li>

                    <li>Compare the third letters: T becomes Y, which is a shift of +5 positions (T->U->V->W->X->Y).</li>
                    <li>The pattern of shifts is +1, +3, +5. We apply this same pattern to the word BIG.</li>
                    <li>B + 1 = C.</li>
                    <li>I + 3 = L.</li>

            <h3>Additional Remarks</h3>
            <div class="remarks">
                <p>When you see unrelated shifts, check if the shifts themselves form a logical sequence. This is a common advanced pattern.</p>

            <h3>Theory</h3>
            <div class="theory">
                <p>In "Odd One Out" problems, you must find a common property or pattern shared by all but one of the options. The option that does not follow this pattern is the answer.</p>

            <h3>Explanation</h3>

            <h3>Theory</h3>
            <div class="theory">
                <p>This problem involves recognizing patterns that use both the forward alphabet (A=1, B=2...) and the reverse alphabet (Z=1, Y=2...). A common pattern is pairing letters that are equidistant from opposite ends of the alphabet (e.g., A and Z, B and Y).</p>

Analyzing the pattern in each group:

A) ABZ:
   A is 1st from start. B is 2nd.
   Z is 1st from end.
   Pattern: First and last letters are positional opposites (A-Z).

B) CDX:
   C is 3rd from start. D is 4th.
   X is 3rd from end.
   Pattern: First and last letters are positional opposites (C-X).

D) GHT:
   G is 7th from start. H is 8th.
   T is 7th from end.
   Pattern: First and last letters are positional opposites (G-T).

C) EFW:
   E is 5th from start. F is 6th.
   W is 4th from end.
   The 5th letter from the end is V, not W.

            <div class="explanation">
                <ol>
                    <li>The pattern in the majority of options is that the first and third letters are a pair from opposite ends of the alphabet (A is 1st, Z is last; C is 3rd from start, X is 3rd from end; G is 7th from start, T is 7th from end).</li>
                    <li>Additionally, the first two letters are always consecutive (AB, CD, GH).</li>
                    <li>Let's check option C: E and F are consecutive, which fits the first part of the pattern. However, E is the 5th letter from the start. The 5th letter from the end is V. The group given is EFW, not EFV.</li>
                    <li>Since EFW does not follow the positional pair rule, it is the odd one out.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Additional Remarks</h3>
            <div class="remarks">
                <p>Familiarity with reverse pairs (A-Z, B-Y, C-X, etc.) is extremely helpful for solving these types of problems quickly. They are a very common pattern in reasoning tests.</p>
