                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> Inversion is a grammatical construction where the normal word order of a sentence is reversed, usually by placing the verb (or helping verb) **before** the subject. The standard order is `Subject + Verb`, while the inverted order is `Verb + Subject`.
                </div>
                <h3>Where and How It Is Used</h3>
                <p>Inversion is not used randomly. It appears in specific grammatical situations, primarily for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Asking Questions:</strong> The most common use of inversion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emphasis:</strong> To make a statement more formal, literary, or emphatic, especially after negative or limiting words.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conditional Clauses:</strong> To create formal conditional sentences without using the word 'if'.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section id="rules" class="content-section">

                    <h3>Rule 1: In Questions</h3>
                    <p><strong>Syntax:</strong> `Helping Verb + Subject + Main Verb?`</p>
                    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> The helping verb (or modal) moves before the subject to form a question.</p>

                    <h3>Rule 2: After Negative or Limiting Adverbials</h3>
                    <p><strong>Syntax:</strong> `Negative Adverbial + Helping Verb + Subject + Main Verb`</p>
                    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> When a sentence starts with a negative or limiting adverbial for emphasis, inversion is mandatory. Common triggers include: `No sooner`, `Hardly`, `Scarcely`, `Rarely`, `Seldom`, `Never`, `Not only`, `Under no circumstances`, `At no time`.</p>

                    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> To form formal conditional clauses by omitting 'if' and inverting the subject and helping verb.</p>

                <h3>A 3-Step Guide to Identification</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>1. Check the Beginning of the Sentence:</strong> Look for sentences that start with something other than a typical subject. Pay close attention to negative words (`Never`, `No sooner`), limiting words (`Only after`, `Hardly`), or conditional helping verbs (`Had`, `Were`, `Should`).</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Locate the Subject and Verb:</strong> Find the main subject and the helping verb of the clause that follows the trigger word.</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Verify the Order:</strong> Check if the helping verb comes **before** the subject.
