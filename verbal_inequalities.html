        <!-- Core Concept -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Core Concept: The Family Priority Rule</h3>
            <p><strong>Question</strong></p>
            <p>How do we determine which symbol to use as the final conclusion when multiple different symbols appear between two elements (e.g., in `A > B >= C`)?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
            <p>The symbol with the highest "priority" becomes the answer.</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
            <p>The speaker introduces a family analogy to remember the priority of symbols:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>> or <</strong> (Greater Than / Less Than) = <strong>Grandfather (दादाजी)</strong> - Highest Priority.</li>
                <li><strong>>= or <=</strong> (Greater/Less Than or Equal to) = <strong>Father (पिताजी)</strong> - Second Priority.</li>
                <li><strong>=</strong> (Equal to) = <strong>Son / Self (तुम)</strong> - Lowest Priority.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The rule is: If you are traveling between two elements and the "Grandfather" symbol appears even once, he will be the answer. If the Grandfather is not present, the "Father" gets priority. The "Son" only becomes the answer if he is the only one present.</p>
            
            <div class="notes">
                <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong> The speaker emphasizes this is the most crucial concept. He says, "If Grandfather is present in the house, his word is final. It doesn't matter how many times the Father or Son appear. The final decision (the answer) belongs to the Grandfather." This analogy is the key to solving 90% of inequality problems quickly.</p>

        <!-- Rule 2: Opposite Signs -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Rule 2: Opposite Signs (Family Conflict)</h3>
            <p><strong>Question</strong></p>
            <p>What is the relationship between A and D in the statement `A > B < C = D`?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
            <p>No Relation / Cannot be Determined.</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
            <p>When traveling from A to D, we encounter signs pointing in opposite directions (`>` and `<`). When this happens, the path is blocked, and no definitive relationship can be established between the start and end points.</p>
            
            <div class="notes">
                <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong> The speaker uses a cultural analogy called "36 का आंकड़ा" ( छत्तीस का आंकड़ा / a figure of 36). In Hindi numerals, 3 (३) and 6 (६) face in opposite directions. The phrase means "to be at odds" or "to have an unresolvable conflict." He explains, "When two different families (the `>` family and the `<` family) meet, they create a '36 ka aankda'. Their relationship cannot be defined, so the answer is always No Relation."</p>

        <!-- Rule 3: The "Either/Or" Case -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Rule 3: The "Either/Or" Case</h3>
            <p><strong>Question</strong></p>
            <p>Given the statement `A > B < C`, what is the correct option for the conclusions below?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conclusion 1: `A > C`</li>
                <li>Conclusion 2: `A <= C`</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
            <p>Either Conclusion 1 or 2 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
            <p>This special case applies under three conditions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The relationship between the elements is "No Relation" (due to opposite signs).</li>
                <li>Both conclusions are individually false.</li>
                <li>The elements in both conclusions are the same (A and C).</li>
                <li>Together, both conclusions cover all three mathematical possibilities (`>`, `<`, `=`). Here, Conclusion 1 covers `>` and Conclusion 2 covers `<` and `=`.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When all these conditions are met, the answer is "Either/Or".</p>
            
            <div class="notes">
                <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong> The speaker explains this with a powerful real-world example. He says, "Imagine two people, Aman and Rashi. You don't know them. Can you tell me their relationship? No. But you know for a fact that one of three things must be true: either Aman is older than Rashi, or Aman is younger than Rashi, or they are the same age. There is NO fourth possibility in the universe. If your conclusions cover all three possibilities, then one of them *must* be true. That is why it is 'Either/Or'."</p>

        <!-- Rule 4: Disconnected Statements -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Rule 4: Disconnected Statements</h3>
            <p><strong>Question</strong></p>
            <p>Given the statements `K > E` and `J < E`, what is the relationship between K and J?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
            <p>`K > J`</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
            <p>To solve this, you must find the common element ('E') to connect the two statements. First, rewrite the second statement to maintain a consistent flow: `J < E` is the same as `E > J`. Now combine them: `K > E` and `E > J` gives `K > E > J`. Applying the family rule, the relationship between K and J is determined by the "Grandfather" symbol, so `K > J`.</p>
            
            <div class="notes">
                <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong> The speaker uses another memorable analogy here: the "marriage middleman" (बिचौलिया). He explains, "If you want to arrange a marriage between two unknown families (K and J), you need a 'middleman' (the common element E) who knows both parties. This middleman connects them and allows you to establish a relationship. Your job is to find that common link."</p>
