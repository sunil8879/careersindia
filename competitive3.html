                <h2>Inversion</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> Inversion is the reversal of the normal subject-verb word order. The verb (or helping verb) comes before the subject.
                </div>
                <h3>Where and How It Is Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**In Questions:** (e.g., `Are you coming?`)</li>
                    <li>**After Negative/Limiting Adverbs:** When a sentence begins with an expression like `No sooner`, `Hardly`, `Never`, or `Not only`, the helping verb and subject must be inverted for formal emphasis.</li>
                    <li>**In Conditional Sentences:** To form formal conditional clauses without 'if'.</li>
                </ul>
