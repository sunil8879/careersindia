            <h2>1. Theory: About the Calendar Test</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Calendar Test</strong> is a key topic in the Logical Reasoning and Quantitative Aptitude sections of Indian government competitive exams (SSC, Banking, Railways, etc.). It assesses a candidate's ability to understand the structure of a calendar and solve problems related to dates and days of the week.</p>
            <p>The core of solving calendar problems lies in the concept of <strong>"odd days"</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts & Techniques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ordinary Year:</strong> An ordinary year has 365 days. When we divide 365 by 7, we get a quotient of 52 (weeks) and a remainder of 1. This remainder is the "odd day". So, an ordinary year has <strong>1 odd day</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Leap Year:</strong> A leap year has 366 days. 366 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 52 (weeks) and a remainder of 2. So, a leap year has <strong>2 odd days</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>How to Identify a Leap Year:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>For a non-century year, it must be divisible by 4 (e.g., 2004, 2016).</li>
                        <li>For a century year, it must be divisible by 400 (e.g., 1600, 2000 are leap years, but 1700, 1900 are not).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Odd Days in Centuries (Diagram):</strong> This is a crucial shortcut.
                    <table class="diagram-table">
                        <thead><tr><th>Number of Years</th><th>Odd Days</th></tr></thead>

                    <p><em>(Note: Any multiple of 400 years, like 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, has 0 odd days).</em></p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Day of the Week based on Odd Days (Diagram):</strong> The final number of odd days corresponds to a day of the week.

                            <p><strong>Technique:</strong> The Odd Day Calculation Method. We calculate the total number of odd days from year 1 up to the given date.</p>
                            <h4>Explanation:</h4>
                            <p>The period is 1946 years + the period from 1st Jan 1947 to 15th Aug 1947.</p>
                            <p><strong>Step 1: Odd days in 1946 years</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Break 1946 into centuries and remaining years: <code>1600 + 300 + 46</code> years.</li>
                                <li>Odd days in 1600 years = 0 (since it's a multiple of 400).</li>
                                <li>Odd days in 300 years = 1.</li>
                                <li>Odd days in 46 years:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Number of leap years = <code>46 / 4 = 11</code>.</li>
                                        <li>Number of ordinary years = <code>46 - 11 = 35</code>.</li>
                                        <li>Total odd days = <code>(11 * 2) + (35 * 1) = 22 + 35 = 57</code> days.</li>
                                        <li><code>57 / 7</code> gives a remainder of <strong>1</strong>.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Total odd days in 1946 years = <code>0 + 1 + 1 = 2</code>.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Step 2: Odd days in the running year (1947)</strong></p>
                            <p>(1947 is an ordinary year, so February has 28 days)</p>

                            <p>Sum of odd days = <code>3+0+3+2+3+2+3+1 = 17</code>. (Or <code>15</code> for Aug days: `3+0+3+2+3+2+3+15 = 31`).
                            <br><code>31 / 7</code> gives a remainder of <strong>3</strong>.

                            <ol>
                                <li>First, find the number of leap years by dividing by 4: <code>400 / 4 = 100</code>.</li>
                                <li>However, this count includes century years that might not be leap years. The century years in this period are 100, 200, 300, and 400.</li>
                                <li>According to the rule, a century year is a leap year only if it is divisible by 400.</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>100 is not divisible by 400 (Not a leap year).</li>

                                        <li>300 is not divisible by 400 (Not a leap year).</li>
                                        <li>400 is divisible by 400 (Is a leap year).</li>

<br>Period: 2004 years + Jan 1 to Mar 1, 2005.
<br><strong>2004 years:</strong> 2000 (0 odd days) + 4 years.
<br>In 4 years: 1 leap (2004) + 3 ordinary. Odd days = (1*2)+(3*1) = 5.
Total for 2004 years = 0+5=5.
<br><strong>2005:</strong> Jan(3) + Feb(0) + Mar(1 day) = 4 odd days.
<br><strong>Total Odd Days:</strong> 5 + 4 = 9. 9/7 rem 2.
<br>So, 1st March 2005 was a Tuesday.
<br>If 1st is Tuesday, 2nd is Wednesday, 3rd is Thursday, then 4th is Friday. The next Fridays will be 4+7=11, 11+7=18, 18+7=25.</p></div></details></li>

<br>2. So, 4th was Monday, 3rd was Sunday, 2nd was Saturday, and the 1st was Friday.
<br>3. The Fridays of the month are: 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th.
<br>4. The third Friday is the 15th.
<br>5. The date 3 days after the 15th is 15 + 3 = 18th.
Wait, let me re-check. 1st Friday is 1st. 2nd Friday is 8th. 3rd Friday is 15th. 3 days after 15th is 18th. Why is the answer 20?
Let's re-read. "5th day of a month is a Tuesday".
5th=Tue, 4th=Mon, 3rd=Sun, 2nd=Sat, 1st=Fri. Okay.
Fridays are 1, 8, 15, 22, 29.
Third Friday is 15th.
3 days after the 15th is the 18th.
The question is "what date will be 3 days after the third Friday". Date = 15+3=18.
Let's check if my calculation of Friday is wrong.
If 5th is Tue -> 6th is Wed, 7th is Thu, 8th is Fri.
Ah, my first step was wrong.
1st=Mon, 2nd=Tue, 3rd=Wed, 4th=Thu, 5th=Fri. No.
If 5th=Tue -> 4th=Mon -> 3rd=Sun -> 2nd=Sat -> 1st=Fri. My calculation for Friday dates is correct. The date is 18th.
This must be an error in the question's standard answer. I will correct it.

<br>Now we need to go to March 3, 1997.
<br>Days remaining in Feb 1997 = 28 - 1 = 27 days (27/7 rem 6).

When will he celebrate his birthday on a Thursday again?</p><p>A) 1900 <br> B) 1901 <br> C) 1904 <br> D) 1905</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> D) 1905</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>We need the total odd days to be a multiple of 7.
<br>1894 -> 1895: 1 odd day (Total=1)
<br>1895 -> 1896: 1 odd day (Total=2)
<br>1896 -> 1897: 2 odd days (1896 is leap) (Total=4)
<br>1897 -> 1898: 1 odd day (Total=5)
<br>1898 -> 1899: 1 odd day (Total=6)
<br>1899 -> 1900: 1 odd day (Total=7). So, Oct 11, 1900 should be a Thursday. BUT, 1900 is NOT a leap year. This calculation is wrong.
Let's check the number of days between Oct 11 and Oct 11.
1894-95: 365 days (1 odd). Day is Fri.
1895-96: 365 days (1 odd). Day is Sat.
1896-97: 366 days (2 odd). Day is Mon.
1897-98: 365 days (1 odd). Day is Tue.
1898-99: 365 days (1 odd). Day is Wed.
1899-00: 365 days (1 odd, 1900 is not leap). Day is Thu. So, 1900.
Wait, let me recheck the leap year rule. 1900 is not divisible by 400. So it is not a leap year. My calculation is correct. Oct 11, 1900 is a Thursday. Why is the answer 1905?
Let's continue from 1900.
1900-01: 365 days (1 odd). Day is Fri.
1901-02: 365 days (1 odd). Day is Sat.
1902-03: 365 days (1 odd). Day is Sun.
1903-04: 365 days (1 odd). Day is Mon.
1904-05: 366 days (2 odd, 1904 is leap). Day is Wed.
The logic says 1900. The standard answer for this question is 1905. Let me find the error.
The rule of adding odd days is correct. Let's start again.
1894 Thu. 1895 Fri (+1). 1896 Sat (+1). 1897 Mon (+2). 1898 Tue (+1). 1899 Wed (+1). 1900 Thu (+1).
This confirms 1900. Let's see how 1905 can be the answer.
Let's continue from 1900 Thu. 1901 Fri (+1). 1902 Sat (+1). 1903 Sun (+1). 1904 Mon (+1). 1905 Wed (+2). No.
Let me check the question date. Oct 11. Leap day Feb 29 is past.
For 1896->1897, the leap day Feb 29 1896 is crossed. So +2 days is correct.
For 1900, it's not a leap year. So 1899->1900 is +1 day. Correct.
For 1904->1905, the leap day Feb 29 1904 is crossed. So +2 days is correct.
The calculation is correct. The common answer must be based on a flawed premise. 1900 is the first year. The next would be 1900+6 = 1906 if it was a standard repetition. But 1900 is a special case.
Let's go with the logically derived answer.
<p><strong>Logically Correct Answer:</strong> A) 1900. (The commonly cited answer is 1905, which is based on an incorrect odd day count around the year 1900).</p>

<p><strong>Corrected Answer:</strong> B) Saturday</p>
<h4>Explanation</h4><p>We are going back one year. The period between Mar 6, 2004 and Mar 6, 2005 contains Feb 29, 2004. This means the year has 366 days (2 odd days). To find the previous year's day, we must subtract 2 days from Monday. Monday - 2 days = Saturday.</p></div></details></li>

In 400 years, there are 400 * 12 = 4800 months.
2. Every month has a 29th day except February in an ordinary year.
3. We need to find the number of times February does NOT have a 29th day. This is the number of ordinary years.
4. Number of leap years in 400 years = 97.
5. Number of ordinary years in 400 years = 400 - 97 = 303.
6. So, the 29th day occurs in every month except for 303 Februaries.
7. Total occurrences = 4800 - 303 = 4497.</p></div></details></li>
                 <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 18:</strong> The year next to 1990 having the same calendar as that of 1990 is:</p><p>A) 1996 <br> B) 1998 <br> C) 2000 <br> D) 2001</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> D) 2001. Wait, let's check. 1990+11 = 2001. Rule for year after leap year is +6. Rule for 2/3 years after leap year is +11. 1988 was leap. 1990 is 2 years after. So +11 is correct.
Let's verify. 1990(1), 91(1), 92(2), 93(1), 94(1), 95(1). Total=7. So 1996 repeats. BUT 1990 is ordinary and 1996 is leap. They cannot repeat.
Continue. 96(2), 97(1), 98(1), 99(1), 2000(2). Total up to end of 2000 = 1+1+2+1+1+1+2+1+1+1+2=14.
So 2001 will repeat.
<p><strong>Corrected Answer:</strong> B) 1996 is not the right choice. Let me re-calculate carefully.
90(1) T=1. 91(1) T=2. 92(2) T=4. 93(1) T=5. 94(1) T=6. 95(1) T=7. Sum=7. So 1996 should repeat. But it can't.
Where did my logic fail? The total odd days must be a multiple of 7 AND the start/end year must be of the same type.
Let's continue sum from 7.
96(2) T=9->2. 97(1) T=3. 98(1) T=4. 99(1) T=5. 2000(2) T=7. Sum is 14 up to end of 2000.
So 2001 will repeat. 1990 and 2001 are both ordinary. This is correct. The answer is 2001. Why B? It must be a typo. Let me write 2001 as an option.

                 <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 21:</strong> What was the day on 1st January 1901?</p><p>A) Sunday <br> B) Monday <br> C) Tuesday <br> D) Wednesday</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Tuesday</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>We need odd days for 1900 years. 1600(0) + 300(1) = 1 odd day for the centuries. For the year 1900, it was an ordinary year (not divisible by 400), so it has 1 odd day. Total odd days for 1900 years = 1+1=2. Wait, the question is for Jan 1, 1901. So we need the odd days at the end of the year 1900.
1600 years=0. 300 years=1. Total for 1900 years is 1 odd day.
Jan 1, 1901 is the next day. So it's Monday + 1 day = Tuesday.
Let me recheck 1900 years. 1600(0) + 300(1). Total is 1. The day on Dec 31, 1900 was Monday. So Jan 1, 1901 was Tuesday. Correct.</p></div></details></li>

<br>July: 31 days (3 odd days)
<br>August: 31 days (3 odd days)
<br>September: 30 days (2 odd days)
<br>October: 27 days (6 odd days)
<br>Total odd days = 1+3+3+2+6 = 15. 15/7 rem 1.

For a century year, it must be divisible by 400.
<br>2000 is divisible by 400 (Leap).
<br>2004 is divisible by 4 (Leap).
<br>1800 is a century year, but not divisible by 400 (Not Leap).
<br>1600 is divisible by 400 (Leap).</p></div></details></li>
                 <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 24:</strong> The first Republic Day of India (26th Jan 1950) was celebrated on a Thursday. On which day was the first Independence Day (15th Aug 1947) celebrated?</p><p>A) Monday <br> B) Wednesday <br> C) Friday <br> D) Saturday</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Friday</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>This can be solved by calculating the day for 15 Aug 1947 directly, which we found to be Friday in Q1. Let's try to work backwards from Jan 26, 1950.
<br>Period: Aug 15, 1947 to Jan 26, 1950.
<br>Days in 1947: Aug(16)+Sep(30)+Oct(31)+Nov(30)+Dec(31) = 138 days. 138/7 rem 5.
<br>Year 1948 (Leap): 2 odd days.
<br>Year 1949 (Ord): 1 odd day.
<br>Days in 1950: Jan 26 days. 26/7 rem 5.
<br>Total odd days = 5+2+1+5=13. 13/7 rem 6.
<br>So, Jan 26, 1950 should be (Day on Aug 15, 1947) + 6 days.
<br>Thursday = Day + 6. Day = Thursday - 6 days = Friday. Correct.</p></div></details></li>
                 <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 25:</strong> Suresh was born on 4th October 1999. Mukesh was born 6 days before Suresh. The Independence Day of that year fell on Sunday. Which day was Mukesh born?</p><p>A) Monday <br> B) Tuesday <br> C) Wednesday <br> D) Thursday</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Wednesday</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. Mukesh was born on Oct 4 - 6 days = Sep 28, 1999.
<br>2. We know Aug 15, 1999 was Sunday. We need the day for Sep 28.
<br>Days remaining in August: 31-15 = 16 (2 odd days).
<br>Days in September: 28 (0 odd days).
<br>Total odd days from Aug 15 = 2+0=2.
<br>The day will be Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday.
Let me check my calculation. Aug 15 Sun. Sep 28 is the day.
Aug: 16 days left.
Sep: 28 days.
Total days = 16+28 = 44. 44/7 rem 2. Sunday+2=Tuesday.
Why is the answer Wednesday?
Let me try counting. Aug 15=Sun. Aug 22=Sun. Aug 29=Sun.
Sep 5=Sun. Sep 12=Sun. Sep 19=Sun. Sep 26=Sun.
If Sep 26 is Sunday, Sep 27 is Monday, Sep 28 is Tuesday.
The answer is consistently Tuesday. I will correct the answer.

However, 2100 is a century year. To be a leap year, it must be divisible by 400. 2100 is not divisible by 400, so it is an ordinary year. The next year divisible by 4 is 2104, which is not a century year, so it is a leap year.</p></div></details></li>

Let's verify. We need sum of odd days to be multiple of 7.
1996(2), 97(1), 98(1), 99(1), 2000(2), 01(1), 02(1), 03(1), 04(2), 05(1), 06(1), 07(1)... this is too long. The rule is the easiest way.
The rule is: A leap year calendar repeats after 28 years. Both 1996 and 2024 are leap years.</p></div></details></li>
                 <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 29:</strong> The first day of the year 1998 was a Thursday. What was the day on the last day of the year 1999?</p><p>A) Thursday <br> B) Friday <br> C) Saturday <br> D) Sunday</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Saturday</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. Year 1998 is an ordinary year (1 odd day). So it starts on Thursday and ends on Thursday.
2. Jan 1, 1999 would be Friday.
3. Year 1999 is also an ordinary year (1 odd day). So it also starts and ends on the same day.
4. Since it starts on a Friday, it will end on a Friday.
Wait, let me check. If a year has 1 odd day, the next year starts one day later.
Jan 1, 1998 = Thu. So Dec 31, 1998 = Thu.
Jan 1, 1999 = Fri.
1999 is an ordinary year, so it also has 1 odd day. Jan 1, 1999 = Fri, so Dec 31, 1999 = Fri.
Why is the answer Saturday? Did I miss a leap year? No.
Let's count. 365 days. 365 = 7*52 + 1. The 365th day is the same as the 1st day. Yes.
So Dec 31, 1998 is Thursday. Jan 1, 1999 is Friday. Dec 31, 1999 is Friday.
The question is consistent. The standard answer must be wrong. I will correct it.
<p><strong>Corrected Answer:</strong> B) Friday</p>

2nd event: 2001 (1997+4). Leap years crossed: 2000. Odd days: 1+1+1+2=5. Day=Mon+5=Sat.
3rd event: 2005 (2001+4). Leap years: 2004. Odd days: 1+1+1+2=5. Day=Sat+5=Thu.
4th event: 2009 (2005+4). Leap years: 2008. Odd days: 1+1+1+2=5. Day=Thu+5=Tue.
5th event: 2013 (2009+4). Leap years: 2012. Odd days: 1+1+1+2=5. Day=Tue+5=Sun.
My calculation gives 2013, Sunday. Let me check the question logic again.
The years are 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2013.
Day shifts: 1997->2001 (+5 days), 2001->2005 (+5 days), 2005->2009 (+5 days), 2009->2013 (+5 days).
Total shift = 5+5+5+5 = 20 days. 20/7 rem 6.
Final day = Monday + 6 days = Sunday.
The standard answer is B. Let me see how. Maybe the question is simpler.
1st 1997. 5th event is 4*4=16 years later. 1997+16 = 2013.
Total odd days in 16 years. Leap years: 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 (4 leap years).
Ordinary years = 12. Odd days = 4*2+12*1=8+12=20. 20/7 rem 6. Monday+6=Sunday.
Calculation is consistently Sunday. I will correct the answer.
<p><strong>Logically Correct Answer:</strong> 2013, Sunday</p>

Let me check again. 1st=Sat. -> 7th=Fri, 6th=Thu, 5th=Wed. Correct.
Wednesdays are 5, 12, 19, 26. This gives 4.
How can it be 5? If the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd day is a Wednesday, there will be 5.

Let's count odd days for full months between Mar and Nov.
Mar(3), Apr(2), May(3), Jun(2), Jul(3), Aug(3), Sep(2), Oct(3) = 21. 21/7 rem 0.

"Tomorrow is a Friday". So Today is Thursday.
2. 3 days after tomorrow (Fri) is Mon. So June 15th is a Monday. Wait, let me re-read. "3 days after tomorrow, WHICH IS a Friday". So Tomorrow is Friday. Today is Thursday.
3 days after Friday is Monday. So June 15 = Monday.
June has 30 days. We need the day on June 30th.
Days from 15th to 30th = 15 days. 15/7 rem 1.
Day on June 30th = Monday + 1 day = Tuesday.
Let me check the answer. C) Wednesday.
Let me try another interpretation. "15th June falls on the day which is 3 days after tomorrow. Tomorrow is Friday".
Today is Thursday. Tomorrow is Friday. The day 3 days after Friday is Monday. So June 15 is Monday. Same result.
Let me try this: "3 days after tomorrow" - Tomorrow is Friday. Day after is Saturday. Day after that is Sunday. So June 15th is Sunday.
If June 15 is Sunday. Days left = 15. 15/7 rem 1. Day on June 30 = Sunday+1 = Monday. Still not Wednesday.
Let's try "tomorrow, which is Friday" as a separate clause.
1. 15th June is 3 days after tomorrow. Let today be X. Tomorrow is X+1. 3 days after is X+4. So June 15 is X+4.
2. Tomorrow is Friday. So X+1 = Fri. X=Thursday.
3. Day on June 15 = X+4 = Thursday+4 = Monday.
All interpretations give Monday or Tuesday. The question must be flawed.
Let's assume June 15 = Wednesday. Last day of month is 30th. Days remaining = 15. 1 odd day. Last day = Wed+1 = Thursday.
I will create a clean question.
<p><strong>Revised Question 45:</strong> If June 10th in a year was a Wednesday, on what day will the last day of that month fall?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> B) Tuesday</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>June has 30 days. We know June 10th is a Wednesday. We need the day on June 30th. Days between them = 30-10=20. 20/7 rem 6. The day will be Wednesday + 6 days = Tuesday.</p>

                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 46:</strong> How many odd days are there in 10 years?</p><p>A) 10 <br> B) 11 <br> C) 12 <br> D) 13</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) 12. Wait, 10 years (e.g., 2001-2010) has 2 leap years (04,08). 8 ordinary. Odd days = 2*2+8*1=12. This is the total odd days, not mod 7.
If the question asks for the remainder, 12/7 rem 5.
Let's assume the question asks for the total odd days count.
But if the 10 years are 1997-2006, leap years are 2000, 2004 (2 leap years). 12 odd days.
If 10 years are 2000-2009, leap years are 2000, 2004, 2008 (3 leap years). 7 ordinary. Odd days = 3*2+7*1=13.
The question is ambiguous. Let's assume a standard 10 year period not spanning a special century. It will have 2 leap years.
<p><strong>Answer (assuming 2 leap years):</strong> 12 odd days. <strong>Answer (assuming 3 leap years):</strong> 13 odd days.</p>

                 <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 47:</strong> The year 2024 started on a Monday. On what day will it end?</p><p>A) Monday <br> B) Tuesday <br> C) Wednesday <br> D) Sunday</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B) Tuesday</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>2024 is divisible by 4, so it is a leap year. A leap year has 366 days (2 odd days). It starts on a Monday. The day shifts by 2-1=1 for the last day. So it ends one day after it started. Monday + 1 = Tuesday.</p></div></details></li>
                 <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 48:</strong> If day before yesterday was Saturday, what day will be the day after tomorrow?</p><p>A) Tuesday <br> B) Wednesday <br> C) Thursday <br> D) Friday</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B) Wednesday</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>Day before yesterday = Sat. Yesterday = Sun. Today = Monday. Tomorrow = Tuesday. Day after tomorrow = Wednesday.</p></div></details></li>
                 <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 49:</strong> If the 3rd of a month is a Monday, which of the following is the 5th day after the 21st of that month?</p><p>A) Monday <br> B) Tuesday <br> C) Wednesday <br> D) Thursday</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Wednesday</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>We need the day on the 21+5 = 26th of the month.
3rd is Monday. Days between 3rd and 26th = 23 days.
23/7 rem 2.
The required day is Monday + 2 days = Wednesday.</p></div></details></li>
                 <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 50:</strong> What was the day on 1st Jan 0001?</p><p>A) Sunday <br> B) Monday <br> C) Saturday <br> D) Friday</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B) Monday</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>The Gregorian calendar system is based on the assumption that the first day, Jan 1, 0001, was a Monday. Our entire odd day calculation system is built on this premise. 0 years have passed, so 0 odd days. The first day is day 1. 1 corresponds to Monday.</p></div></details></li>
