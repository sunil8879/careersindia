                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> Determiners are words that come at the beginning of a noun phrase. They introduce the noun and specify its reference. Think of them as "pointers" or "labels" for nouns. Quantifiers are a specific type of determiner that indicates the quantity or amount of the noun.
                </div>
                <h3>Key Functions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> Do we mean a specific noun (`the book`) or a general one (`a book`)?</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> How much (`much water`) or how many (`many books`)?</li>
                    <li><strong>Possession:</strong> Whose is it (`my book`)?</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Is it near or far (`this book` vs. `that book`)?</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Core Rule: Countable vs. Uncountable Nouns</h3>
                    <p>The most important rule for quantifiers is choosing the correct one based on whether the noun is countable (can be counted, e.g., `one book`, `two books`) or uncountable (cannot be counted, e.g., `water`, `information`).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>For Countable Nouns:</strong> `many`, `few`, `a few`, `several`, `both`.</li>
                        <li><strong>For Uncountable Nouns:</strong> `much`, `little`, `a little`.</li>
                        <li><strong>For Both:</strong> `all`, `some`, `any`, `no`, `a lot of`, `enough`.</li>

                    <h3>Syntax</h3>
                    <p>Determiners almost always appear **before** the noun and any adjectives describing it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Structure:</strong> `Determiner + [Adjective(s)] + Noun`</p>
                    <p><em>Example: <span class="feature">The</span> <span class="feature">tall</span> <span class="feature">boy</span>. / <span class="feature">My</span> <span class="feature">new</span> <span class="feature">car</span>.</em></p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>1. Find the Noun:</strong> First, locate the main person, place, thing, or idea in the phrase.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Look at the Word(s) Before the Noun:</strong> Check for specific pointer/quantity words right before the noun (or before its adjectives).</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Ask a Function Question:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Does it answer **"Which one?"** (e.g., `the`, `this`, `my`) → It's a specifying determiner.</li>
                            <li>Does it answer **"How many?"** (e.g., `many`, `five`, `a few`) → It's a quantifier for a countable noun.</li>
                            <li>Does it answer **"How much?"** (e.g., `much`, `a little`) → It's a quantifier for an uncountable noun.</li>
