                <h3>Conjunctive Adverbs</h3>
                <p>These connect two independent clauses, showing a relationship between them. They are often preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.</p>

                <h2>Handy Tip: The "-ly" Rule</h2>
                <p>A common way to form an adverb is by adding **-ly** to an adjective. However, be careful: not all words ending in -ly are adverbs!</p>
                
                <h3>Adjectives Ending in -ly (Common Traps)</h3>
                <p>The following words are adjectives, not adverbs. They describe nouns.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>She has a **friendly** personality.</li>

                <h2>How to Identify Adverbs: 10 Techniques</h2>

                <h3>1. Meaning-Based Technique (How, When, Where Test)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Adverbs add details to a sentence by describing *how, when, where, why,* or *to what extent* something happens.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He drove the car **carefully**. (Tells *how* he drove)</li>
                    <li>She will arrive **soon**. (Tells *when* she will arrive)</li>
                    <li>The children are playing **outside**. (Tells *where* they are playing)</li>
                    <li>She was **extremely** happy. (Tells *to what extent* she was happy)</li>
                    <li>They **often** visit their grandparents. (Tells *how often* they visit)</li>
                    <li>He spoke **angrily**. (How?)</li>
                    <li>We will leave **now**. (When?)</li>
                    <li>She looked **everywhere** for her keys. (Where?)</li>
                    <li>He **fully** understands the situation. (To what extent?)</li>
                    <li>I **rarely** eat junk food. (How often?)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Modification Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> The main job of an adverb is to modify a **verb**, an **adjective**, or another **adverb**.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The bird sang **sweetly**. (Modifies verb 'sang')</li>
                    <li>The movie was **incredibly** exciting. (Modifies adjective 'exciting')</li>
                    <li>He ran **very** quickly. (Modifies adverb 'quickly')</li>
                    <li>She **quietly** opened the door. (Modifies verb 'opened')</li>
                    <li>The room was **surprisingly** large. (Modifies adjective 'large')</li>
                    <li>He worked **exceptionally** hard. (Modifies adverb 'hard')</li>
                    <li>They **completely** renovated the house. (Modifies verb 'renovated')</li>
                    <li>The test was **deceptively** simple. (Modifies adjective 'simple')</li>
                    <li>She spoke **almost** inaudibly. (Modifies adverb 'inaudibly')</li>
                    <li>He **suddenly** realized his mistake. (Modifies verb 'realized')</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3. Movability Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Unlike many other parts of speech, adverbs can often be moved to different positions in a sentence without changing the basic meaning.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>Suddenly,</strong> the phone rang. / The phone <strong>suddenly</strong> rang.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fortunately,</strong> he passed the exam. / He, <strong>fortunately,</strong> passed the exam.</li>

                <h3>4. Question Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A simple way to find an adverb is to ask a question about the verb. Adverbs often answer: *How? When? Where? Why? How often?*</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>She danced **gracefully**. (How did she dance?)</li>
                    <li>He left the party **early**. (When did he leave?)</li>
                    <li>Put the box **there**. (Where should I put the box?)</li>
                    <li>They **rarely** go to the cinema. (How often do they go?)</li>
                    <li>The train moved **slowly**. (How did the train move?)</li>
                    <li>He will arrive **tomorrow**. (When will he arrive?)</li>

                    <li>He **always** tells the truth. (How often does he tell the truth?)</li>
                    <li>I visit my family **annually**. (How often do I visit?)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>5. Suffix Test (-ly)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> The most common sign of an adverb is the **-ly** suffix. Many adjectives can be turned into adverbs by adding -ly.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He solved the puzzle **quickly**.</li>
                    <li>She spoke **softly** so as not to wake the baby.</li>

                    <li>She **generously** donated to the charity.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>6. Comparative & Superlative Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Just like adjectives, some adverbs can be changed to show comparison using -er/-est or more/most.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He runs **fast**, but she runs **faster**.</li>
                    <li>She arrived **earlier** than everyone else.</li>
                    <li>You need to speak **more clearly**.</li>

                    <li>He arrived **sooner** than expected.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>7. Adjective vs. Adverb Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Ask what the word is describing. If it describes a noun/pronoun, it's an adjective. If it describes a verb, adjective, or another adverb, it's an adverb.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He is a <strong>quick</strong> runner. (adjective) vs. He runs <strong>quickly</strong>. (adverb)</li>
                    <li>She has a <strong>loud</strong> voice. (adjective) vs. She speaks <strong>loudly</strong>. (adverb)</li>

                    <li>The train is <strong>late</strong>. (adjective) vs. He arrived <strong>late</strong>. (adverb)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>8. Intensifier Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Many adverbs act as "intensifiers" to strengthen or weaken the meaning of the word they modify. Common intensifiers are *very, really, extremely, quite, rather, too*.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The water is **very** cold.</li>
                    <li>I am **quite** sure about my answer.</li>

                    <li>He is **fairly** confident about his chances.</li>
                    <li>This is **absolutely** fantastic!</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>9. Negation Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A special group of adverbs is used to negate or limit a verb. Words like *not, never, hardly, rarely,* and *seldom* are adverbs.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He has **never** been to Japan.</li>
                    <li>She does **not** like spicy food.</li>

                    <li>I **hardly** ever see him anymore.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>10. Extra Technique: The "How, When, Where" Question</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> To find the most common adverbs, first find the main verb. Then, ask one of three simple questions about that verb: *"How?"*, *"When?"*, or *"Where?"*. The word that answers is your adverb.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>Sentence: The boy shouted **loudly**. (How did he shout?)</li>
