    <h1>Study in Russia: Verification and Complete Application Process</h1>

    <div class="section-item">
        <strong>Verification Body Name:</strong>
        <p>There is <strong>no government body for licensing study abroad consultants</strong> in Russia. The system is state-controlled, and verification is tied to the universities.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Institutional Accreditation:</strong> The primary authority is the <strong>Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (<span class="acronym">Minobrnauki</span>)</strong>. A genuine consultant will only represent state-accredited universities.</li>
            <li><strong>Official University Contract:</strong> The most reliable "test" is to confirm that the consultant has an official, signed contract to act as a recruitment representative for a specific Russian university. You can ask the consultant for a copy of this authorization or verify their status with the university's international department.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section-item">

        <p>For Institution & Scholarship Information: <a href="https://studyinrussia.ru/en/" target="_blank">Study in Russia (Official Portal)</a></p>
        <p>For Ministry Information: <a href="https://minobrnauki.gov.ru/" target="_blank">Minobrnauki Official Website (in Russian)</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-item">
        <strong>Location in Russia:</strong>
        <p>Moscow. The Ministry of Science and Higher Education is a federal ministry headquartered in the capital.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-item">
        <strong>Total Process Time:</strong>
        <p><strong>4 to 7 months.</strong> The single biggest factor in this timeline is the processing of the official "Invitation Letter" by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, which can take 1-2 months alone.</p>
    </div>

<div class="section-item">
    <strong>Visa Type for Studying:</strong>
    <p>Initially, a <strong>Single-Entry Student Visa</strong> (valid for 90 days). After arrival and registration in Russia, this is converted into a <strong>Multiple-Entry Visa</strong>, which is renewed annually.</p>
</div>

    <div class="section-item process-steps">
        <strong>Overall Process (From Initial Query to Landing in Russia)</strong>

        <h3>Phase 1: Pre-Application & Document Legalization (1-2 Months)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 1: Initial Query & Profile Assessment</h4>
                <p>A student contacts an agent, who evaluates their academic background. Many Russian universities offer a preparatory year for students to learn the Russian language before starting their main degree program.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 2: University Selection & Contract</h4>
                <p>The consultant helps the student select a state-accredited university and program. Once chosen, the student often signs a preliminary contract with the university and pays an initial application or processing fee.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 3: Document Preparation, Translation & Legalization (Crucial Step)</h4>
                <p>The consultant assists in gathering and preparing all necessary documents. This is a meticulous process.</p>
                <p class="doc-list">
                    <strong>Key Documents:</strong><br>
                    - Academic Certificates: These must be <strong>legalized</strong> (either by Apostille or consular legalization) and then translated into Russian by an official translator.<br>
                    - Passport Copy: Must be valid for at least 1.5 years from the intended start date of the visa.<br>
                    - Medical Certificates: Including a general health certificate and, most importantly, a <strong>negative HIV test certificate</strong>, which is mandatory for the visa.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Phase 2: Admission & The Official Invitation Letter (2-3 Months)</h3>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>
                <h4>Step 4: Application Submission to University</h4>
                <p>The consultant submits the complete package of legalized and translated documents to the university's international department.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 5: University Applies for the Invitation Letter</h4>
                <p>This is the core of the process. After the university accepts the student, they submit an application on the student's behalf to the local office of the <strong>General Administration for Migration Issues of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (<span class="acronym">GUVM MVD</span>)</strong>. This department processes and issues the official <strong>Invitation Letter</strong> (`Priglasheniye`). The student cannot apply for this directly and must wait for the university to secure it.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <h4>Step 6: Receiving the Invitation Letter</h4>
                <p>Once issued, the university receives the Invitation Letter (often in electronic format now) and forwards it to the student. This document is essential for the visa application.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Phase 3: The Student Visa Application (1 Month)</h3>
        <ol start="7">
            <li>
                <h4>Step 7: Applying for the Single-Entry Student Visa</h4>
                <p>With the Invitation Letter, the student applies for an initial, single-entry student visa (valid for 90 days) at the Russian Embassy, Consulate, or official Visa Application Center in their home country.</p>
                <p class="doc-list">
                    <strong>Key Visa Documents:</strong> Passport, completed visa application form, photographs, the official Invitation Letter from the MVD, legalized academic documents, and the negative HIV test certificate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 8: The Interview Process</h4>
                <p>A formal, in-depth interview is <strong>not a standard part of the Russian visa process</strong>. The application is almost entirely document-based. The appointment at the consulate is for submitting the application and verifying that all paperwork is in order. A consular officer can, however, request to speak with an applicant if they find any discrepancies, but this is rare.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Phase 4: Arrival & Mandatory In-Country Registration (1 Month)</h3>
        <ol start="9">
            <li>
                <h4>Step 9: Landing in Russia & The Migration Card</h4>
                <p>Upon arrival, the student presents their passport and visa. At immigration, they will be given a <strong>Migration Card</strong>. This is a small, two-part paper form that they must fill out. The border officer will stamp it and return one half to the student. <strong>It is crucial to keep this card safe for the entire duration of the stay.</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 10: Migration Registration (Mandatory & Time-Sensitive)</h4>
                <p>This is a critical legal requirement. Within <strong>7 working days of arrival</strong>, the student MUST be registered with the local migration authorities. The university's international student department will handle this process. The student provides their passport and Migration Card to the university, which then registers their address. The student receives a stamped registration slip as proof.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 11: Final Documentation: The Multiple-Entry Visa (Final Step)</h4>
                <p>The initial 90-day, single-entry visa must be extended and converted into a <strong>multiple-entry visa</strong>. This is done in Russia after arrival and registration. The university's international office will again assist the student in submitting an application to the local MVD office. This new, multiple-entry visa will be valid for one year and allows the student to travel in and out of Russia. It must be renewed annually.</p>
            </li>
