                <h2>How to Identify Prepositions: 10 Techniques</h2>

                <h3>1. Meaning-Based Technique (Relation Test)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A preposition is a "relationship word." It shows the relationship between a noun/pronoun and another word, often related to location, time, or direction.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The book is <strong>on</strong> the table. (Location)</li>
                    <li>The meeting will start <strong>at</strong> 10 AM. (Time)</li>
                    <li>She walked <strong>toward</strong> the park. (Direction)</li>
                    <li>This letter is <strong>for</strong> you. (Purpose)</li>
                    <li>He is the president <strong>of</strong> the company. (Possession)</li>
                    <li>They live <strong>near</strong> the school. (Location)</li>
                    <li>We will meet <strong>after</strong> the class. (Time)</li>
                    <li>He jumped <strong>over</strong> the fence. (Direction)</li>
                    <li>She succeeded <strong>with</strong> her team's help. (Manner)</li>
                    <li>The gift came <strong>from</strong> my aunt. (Source)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Fixed Position Test (Pre-position)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A preposition almost always comes directly **before** a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase (its object).</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The cat is hiding <strong>under</strong> the bed.</li>
                    <li>She gave the gift <strong>to</strong> him.</li>
                    <li>He lives <strong>in</strong> a big city.</li>
                    <li>We cannot live <strong>without</strong> water.</li>
                    <li>Let's meet <strong>after</strong> the class.</li>
                    <li>He sat <strong>beside</strong> the window.</li>
                    <li>The car is parked <strong>behind</strong> the building.</li>
                    <li>They walked <strong>along</strong> the river.</li>
                    <li>She put the keys <strong>inside</strong> her bag.</li>
                    <li>He is the captain <strong>of</strong> the team.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3. Object Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A word is only a preposition if it has an object (a noun or pronoun that follows it). If there's no object, it's likely an adverb.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He is waiting <strong>in</strong> the car. (Object: the car)</li>
                    <li>She put the keys <strong>on</strong> the counter. (Object: the counter)</li>
                    <li>The dog ran <strong>across</strong> the field. (Object: the field)</li>
                    <li>I received a message <strong>from</strong> my boss. (Object: my boss)</li>
                    <li>He is hiding <strong>behind</strong> the curtain. (Object: the curtain)</li>
                    <li>She is talking <strong>about</strong> her vacation. (Object: her vacation)</li>
                    <li>They are sitting <strong>near</strong> the fireplace. (Object: the fireplace)</li>
                    <li>He argued <strong>against</strong> the proposal. (Object: the proposal)</li>
                    <li>We walked <strong>towards</strong> the exit. (Object: the exit)</li>
                    <li>The book is written <strong>by</strong> a famous author. (Object: a famous author)</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>4. Deletion Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> If you remove a preposition from a sentence, the sentence will usually become grammatically incorrect or lose its meaning.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>Correct: The keys are **in** my pocket. → Incorrect: The keys are my pocket.</li>
                    <li>Correct: He depends **on** his friends. → Incorrect: He depends his friends.</li>
                    <li>Correct: She is talking **about** her vacation. → Incorrect: She is talking her vacation.</li>
                    <li>Correct: Let's go **for** a walk. → Incorrect: Let's go a walk.</li>
                    <li>Correct: The store is **near** the post office. → Incorrect: The store is the post office.</li>
                    <li>Correct: The book was written **by** him. → Incorrect: The book was written him.</li>
                    <li>Correct: He is waiting **at** the bus stop. → Incorrect: He is waiting the bus stop.</li>
                    <li>Correct: The cat jumped **onto** the roof. → Incorrect: The cat jumped the roof.</li>
                    <li>Correct: She is responsible **for** this project. → Incorrect: She is responsible this project.</li>
                    <li>Correct: He is listening **to** music. → Incorrect: He is listening music.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>5. Question Test (Where? When? How?)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A prepositional phrase (the preposition + its object) often answers key questions like *Where?, When?,* or *How?*</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>They live **in London**. (Where do they live?)</li>
                    <li>The game starts **at noon**. (When does the game start?)</li>
                    <li>He traveled **by train**. (How did he travel?)</li>
                    <li>She went to the store **for milk**. (Why did she go?)</li>
                    <li>The man **with the hat** is my uncle. (Which man?)</li>
                    <li>He put the book **on the shelf**. (Where did he put it?)</li>
                    <li>We will leave **after breakfast**. (When will we leave?)</li>
                    <li>She spoke **with confidence**. (How did she speak?)</li>
                    <li>The letter **from my sister** arrived. (Which letter?)</li>
                    <li>He is hiding **behind the door**. (Where is he hiding?)</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>6. Common Prepositions List Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> One of the easiest methods is to recognize the word from a list of common prepositions (e.g., *in, on, at, by, with, for, of, about, under, over, from, to*).</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He sat <strong>on</strong> the chair.</li>
                    <li>She is the captain <strong>of</strong> the team.</li>
                    <li>I'll go <strong>with</strong> you.</li>
                    <li>This package came <strong>from</strong> my aunt.</li>
                    <li>He put the letter <strong>in</strong> the envelope.</li>
                    <li>We arrived <strong>at</strong> the airport.</li>
                    <li>This book is <strong>about</strong> history.</li>
                    <li>He traveled <strong>by</strong> bus.</li>
                    <li>This gift is <strong>for</strong> my mother.</li>
                    <li>The bridge goes <strong>over</strong> the river.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>7. Prepositional Phrase Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A preposition is always the head of a "prepositional phrase" (preposition + object). This entire phrase acts as a single unit, like an adjective or an adverb.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The man **in the blue shirt** is my brother. (Acts like an adjective, describing 'man')</li>
                    <li>She ran **with great speed**. (Acts like an adverb, describing 'ran')</li>
                    <li>The house **on the corner** is for sale. (Acts like an adjective, describing 'house')</li>
                    <li>He spoke **with confidence**. (Acts like an adverb, describing 'spoke')</li>
                    <li>The book **about pirates** was exciting. (Acts like an adjective, describing 'book')</li>
                    <li>They arrived **at midnight**. (Acts like an adverb, describing 'arrived')</li>
                    <li>The keys **to the car** are missing. (Acts like an adjective, describing 'keys')</li>
                    <li>He works **at a large company**. (Acts like an adverb, describing 'works')</li>
                    <li>The girl **with the red hair** is my cousin. (Acts like an adjective, describing 'girl')</li>
                    <li>She painted the picture **with skill**. (Acts like an adverb, describing 'painted')</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>8. No Inflection Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Prepositions do not change their form. You cannot add endings like *-s, -ed,* or *-ing* to them. The word *on* is always *on*.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He is **on** the roof. (Cannot be 'ons' or 'oned')</li>
                    <li>She walked **through** the park. (Cannot be 'throughs' or 'throughed')</li>
                    <li>The gift is **from** me. (Always 'from')</li>
                    <li>He is hiding **under** the table. (Always 'under')</li>
                    <li>The story is **about** a dragon. (Always 'about')</li>
                    <li>They live **near** the station.</li>
                    <li>The cat is **behind** the sofa.</li>
                    <li>We will go **to** the market.</li>
                    <li>He sat **beside** his friend.</li>
                    <li>She argued **against** the idea.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>9. Particle Test (Distinction from Adverbs)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Some words (like *up, down, in, out*) can be prepositions or adverbs. It's a **preposition** if it has a noun/pronoun object after it. It's an **adverb** if it doesn't.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>Preposition: He looked **up** the chimney. | Adverb: Please look **up**.</li>
                    <li>Preposition: She ran **down** the hill. | Adverb: The computer shut **down**.</li>
                    <li>Preposition: Come **inside** the house. | Adverb: Come **inside**.</li>
                    <li>Preposition: He walked **past** the shop. | Adverb: A car just drove **past**.</li>
                    <li>Preposition: She is **in** the room. | Adverb: Please come **in**.</li>
