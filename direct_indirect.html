                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> Quoting the exact words of the speaker. It is enclosed in quotation marks ("...").</li>
                    <li><strong>Indirect Speech (Reported Speech):</strong> Reporting the speaker's message in your own words. It is not enclosed in quotation marks.</li>

                <h2>General Rules for Conversion (Direct to Indirect)</h2>
                <h3>Rule 1: Change of Reporting Verb</h3>
                <p>The reporting verb (e.g., `said`, `told`) changes based on the type of sentence being reported.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>`said to` often changes to `told` (for statements).</li>
                    <li>`said` can remain `said` or change to `asked`, `ordered`, `exclaimed`, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Rule 2: Change of Pronouns</h3>
                <p>Pronouns are changed according to the perspective of the reporter.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Person</th><th>Rule</th><th>Example</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>First Person (I, me, my, we)</td><td>Changes according to the <strong>Subject</strong> of the reporting verb.</td><td>He said, "<strong>I</strong> am fine." → He said that <strong>he</strong> was fine.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Second Person (you, your)</td><td>Changes according to the <strong>Object</strong> of the reporting verb.</td><td>She said to me, "<strong>You</strong> are lucky." → She told me that <strong>I</strong> was lucky.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Third Person (he, she, it, they)</td><td><strong>No Change</strong>.</td><td>He said, "<strong>She</strong> is working." → He said that <strong>she</strong> was working.</td></tr>
                </table>
                 <h3>Rule 3: Change of Tense (Backshift)</h3>
                <p>If the reporting verb is in the past tense (e.g., `said`), the tense of the reported speech is shifted back.</p>
                 <table>
                    <tr><th>Direct Speech Tense</th><th>Indirect Speech Tense</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>Simple Present (V1/V1+s)</td><td>Simple Past (V2)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Present Continuous (is/am/are + V-ing)</td><td>Past Continuous (was/were + V-ing)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Present Perfect (has/have + V3)</td><td>Past Perfect (had + V3)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Simple Past (V2)</td><td>Past Perfect (had + V3)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Past Continuous (was/were + V-ing)</td><td>Past Perfect Continuous (had been + V-ing)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Future (will)</td><td>Conditional (would)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Can / May</td><td>Could / Might</td></tr>
                </table>
                <div class="note"><strong>Exception:</strong> No tense change occurs if the reporting verb is in the present/future tense (e.g., `he says`) or if the reported speech is a universal truth (e.g., `The sun rises in the east`).</div>
                <h3>Rule 4: Change of Time and Place Adverbs</h3>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Direct Speech</th><th>Indirect Speech</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>now</td><td>then</td></tr>

                </table>
                <h3>Rule 5: Punctuation Changes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quotation marks ("...") are removed.</li>
                    <li>A conjunction like `that`, `if`, or `whether` is usually added after the reporting verb.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Rules for Different Sentence Types</h2>
                <h3>1. Statements (Assertive Sentences)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The reporting verb `said to` changes to `told`. `said` remains `said`.</li>
                    <li>The conjunction `that` is used to connect the reporting clause with the reported speech.</li>
                </ul>
                 <h3>2. Questions (Interrogative Sentences)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The reporting verb `said to` changes to `asked`, `inquired`, or `demanded`.</li>
                    <li>For Yes/No questions, the conjunction is `if` or `whether`.</li>
                    <li>For Wh-questions (what, where, why), the Wh-word itself acts as the conjunction.</li>
                    <li>The question format is changed to a statement format (Subject + Verb).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>3. Commands & Requests (Imperative Sentences)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The reporting verb changes to `ordered`, `commanded`, `requested`, `advised`, `forbade`, etc., based on the meaning.</li>
                    <li>The main verb of the reported speech is changed to an infinitive (`to + V1`). For negative commands, use `not to + V1`.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4. Exclamations & Wishes (Exclamatory Sentences)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The reporting verb changes to `exclaimed with joy`, `exclaimed with sorrow`, `wished`, etc.</li>
                    <li>The exclamatory sentence is changed into an assertive statement using the conjunction `that`.</li>

                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> `I` -> `he`. `bought` (Simple Past) -> `had bought` (Past Perfect). `this` -> `that`. `yesterday` -> `the previous day`.</div>

                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> No change in tense because the reporting verb `says` is in the present tense, and the reported speech is a universal truth.</div>

                <h2>10 Examples: Indirect to Direct Speech</h2>
                <ul class="example-list">
                    <li>
                        <span class="speech-label indirect-speech">Indirect:</span> He told me that he was busy then.<br>
                        <span class="speech-label direct-speech">Direct:</span> He said to me, "I am busy now."<br>
                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Invert the rules: `told` -> `said to`. Add quotation marks. `he` -> `I`. `was busy` (Past Cont.) -> `am busy` (Present Cont.). `then` -> `now`.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="speech-label indirect-speech">Indirect:</span> She asked me if I could help her.<br>
                        <span class="speech-label direct-speech">Direct:</span> She said to me, "Can you help me?"<br>
                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> `asked` -> `said to`. Remove `if`. `I could` -> `Can you`. `her` -> `me`. Add a question mark.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="speech-label indirect-speech">Indirect:</span> The teacher advised the students not to waste their time.<br>
                        <span class="speech-label direct-speech">Direct:</span> The teacher said to the students, "Do not waste your time."<br>
                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> `advised` -> `said to`. The infinitive `not to waste` becomes a negative command `Do not waste`. `their` -> `your`.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="speech-label indirect-speech">Indirect:</span> He asked me where I lived.<br>
                        <span class="speech-label direct-speech">Direct:</span> He said to me, "Where do you live?"<br>
                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> `asked` -> `said to`. The statement `I lived` becomes a question `do you live`. The tense shifts from past back to present.</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="speech-label indirect-speech">Indirect:</span> They exclaimed with joy that they had won the game.<br>
                        <span class="speech-label direct-speech">Direct:</span> They said, "Hurray! We have won the game."<br>
                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> `exclaimed with joy` is represented by `Hurray!`. `they had won` (Past Perfect) -> `We have won` (Present Perfect).</div>
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <span class="speech-label indirect-speech">Indirect:</span> My father ordered me to go to my room.<br>
                        <span class="speech-label direct-speech">Direct:</span> My father said to me, "Go to your room."<br>
                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> `ordered` -> `said to`. The infinitive `to go` becomes the base verb `Go` in a command.</div>
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <span class="speech-label indirect-speech">Indirect:</span> She said that her mother would arrive the next day.<br>
                        <span class="speech-label direct-speech">Direct:</span> She said, "My mother will arrive tomorrow."<br>
                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> `her` -> `My`. `would arrive` -> `will arrive`. `the next day` -> `tomorrow`.</div>
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <span class="speech-label indirect-speech">Indirect:</span> He said that the Earth moves around the Sun.<br>
                        <span class="speech-label direct-speech">Direct:</span> He said, "The Earth moves around the Sun."<br>
                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> Since it's a universal truth, the tense remains the same in both forms. Just add punctuation.</div>
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <span class="speech-label indirect-speech">Indirect:</span> She requested him to wait there.<br>
                        <span class="speech-label direct-speech">Direct:</span> She said to him, "Please wait here."<br>
                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation:</strong> `requested` implies `Please`. `to wait` becomes `wait`. `there` becomes `here`.</div>
                    </li>
