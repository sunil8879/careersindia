                <h2>What is Voice?</h2>
                <p>In grammar, **voice** refers to the form of a verb that shows whether the subject of a sentence **performs the action** (active voice) or **receives the action** (passive voice).</p>
                <div class="rule">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Active Voice:</strong> The subject **DOES** the action.<br><em>Example: The cat chased the mouse.</em> (The subject 'cat' is doing the chasing).</li>
                        <li><strong>Passive Voice:</strong> The subject **RECEIVES** the action.<br><em>Example: The mouse was chased by the cat.</em> (The subject 'mouse' is receiving the action).</li>

                <h2>The Active Voice</h2>
                <p>In the active voice, the subject of the sentence is the one performing the action expressed by the verb.</p>
                <h3>Structure</h3>
                <p>The standard structure is: <code>Subject + Verb + Object</code></p>
                <h3>When to Use the Active Voice</h3>
                <ul class="example-list">
                    <li>For clear, direct, and strong writing. This is the most common and generally preferred voice in English.</li>
                    <li>When you want to emphasize the person or thing performing the action.</li>
                    <li>To make your writing more concise and engaging.</li>

                <h2>The Passive Voice</h2>
                <p>In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence receives the action. The person or thing performing the action (the agent) may be introduced with the preposition 'by' or omitted entirely.</p>
                <h3>Structure</h3>
                <p>The standard structure is: <code>Subject (Receiver) + Form of 'be' + Past Participle (V3) + [by Agent (Doer)]</code></p>
                 <h3>When to Use the Passive Voice</h3>
                <ul class="example-list">
                    <li>When the doer of the action is unknown.<br><em>Example: My wallet <strong>was stolen</strong> yesterday. (We don't know who stole it).</em></li>
                    <li>When the doer of the action is unimportant or irrelevant.<br><em>Example: The bridge <strong>was built</strong> in 1995. (Who built it is less important than the bridge itself).</em></li>
                    <li>When the receiver of the action is more important and needs to be emphasized.<br><em>Example: The Nobel Prize <strong>was won</strong> by a brilliant scientist. (The focus is on the prize).</em></li>
                    <li>In scientific or formal writing to sound objective.<br><em>Example: The solution <strong>was heated</strong> to 100 degrees Celsius.</em></li>
                    <li>To avoid assigning blame.<br><em>Example: Unfortunately, a mistake <strong>was made</strong>.</em></li>

                        <li>The **subject** of the active sentence becomes the **object** of the preposition 'by' (or is omitted if unimportant).</li>
