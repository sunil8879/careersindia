            <h2>1. Theory: About Statement and Conclusions</h2>
            <p><strong>Statement and Conclusions</strong> is a type of logical reasoning question where you are given a statement (or a passage) followed by a set of conclusions. Your task is to determine which of the conclusions logically and definitively follow from the information provided in the statement. You must not use any external knowledge and should treat the given statement as the only source of truth.</p>
            <h3>Core Techniques & Approach</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Read the Statement as Absolute Truth:</strong> Even if the statement is factually incorrect (e.g., "All dogs can fly"), you must accept it as true for the purpose of the question.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify the Core Idea:</strong> Understand the main message, keywords, and scope of the statement.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate Each Conclusion Independently:</strong> A conclusion must be a <strong>100% logical consequence</strong>. If there is any doubt or if it's just a possibility, it does not follow.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid External Knowledge:</strong> Do not use your own knowledge or opinions. Your evaluation must be based solely on the information given in the statement.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch for Extreme Words:</strong> Conclusions with words like "all," "only," "always," "never" are often invalid. Conversely, words like "some," "may," "can" are often part of valid conclusions (but must still be logically derived).</li>

                <h4>Difficulty Level 1: Easy (Questions 1-10)</h4>
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 1:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> In a one-day cricket match, the total runs made by a team were 200. Out of these 160 runs were made by spinners.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. 80% of the team consists of spinners. II. The opening batsmen were spinners.</p><div class="conclusion-options"><p>A) Only I follows<br>B) Only II follows<br>C) Both follow<br>D) Neither follows</p></div><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> D) Neither follows</p><h4>Diagram (Logical Analysis)</h4><div class="diagram-box">Statement: 160/200 runs from spinners.
Conclusion I: 80% of TEAM (players) are spinners? -> Data is about runs, not player types. Invalid.
Conclusion II: Opening batsmen were spinners? -> No data on who scored when. Invalid.</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The statement gives data about runs, not the composition of the team. We cannot conclude that 80% of the players are spinners. So, I does not follow.<br>II. The statement gives no information about which player scored when. So, II does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 2:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Mercy is a divine quality. II. Mercy cannot be forced.</p><div class="conclusion-options"><p>A) Only I follows<br>B) Only II follows<br>C) Both follow<br>D) Neither follows</p></div><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Both follow</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The phrase "rain from heaven" metaphorically suggests a divine or natural origin. So, I follows.<br>II. "Not strained" means not forced or constrained. This directly implies it cannot be forced. So, II follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 3:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> All successful people are hardworking. All hardworking people are honest.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. All successful people are honest. II. Some honest people are successful.</p><div class="conclusion-options"><p>A) Only I follows<br>B) Only II follows<br>C) Both follow<br>D) Neither follows</p></div><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Both follow</p><h4>Diagram (Logical Chain)</h4><div class="diagram-box">Successful -> Hardworking -> Honest</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. A direct logical chain is formed. If someone is successful, they are hardworking, and therefore honest. So, I follows.<br>II. Since all successful people are a part of the group of honest people, it means at least 'some' honest people are successful. So, II follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 4:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> Regular reading of newspapers enhances one's general knowledge.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Newspapers contain information related to general knowledge. II. People who do not read newspapers have poor general knowledge.</p><div class="conclusion-options"><p>A) Only I follows<br>B) Only II follows<br>C) Both follow<br>D) Neither follows</p></div><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) Only I follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. For newspapers to enhance GK, they must contain GK-related information. Follows.<br>II. The statement says reading newspapers is *one way* to enhance GK, not the *only* way. People could learn from other sources. Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 5:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The best evidence of India's glorious past is the growing popularity of Ayurvedic medicines in the West.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Ayurvedic medicines are not popular in India. II. Allopathic medicines are more popular in India.</p><div class="conclusion-options"><p>A) Only I follows<br>B) Only II follows<br>C) Both follow<br>D) Neither follows</p></div><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> D) Neither follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>The statement is only about the popularity of Ayurveda in the West. It provides no information to compare its popularity in India or to compare it with Allopathy. Both conclusions are outside the scope of the statement.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 6:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The Indian cricket team is expected to win the match against Australia as the match is being played in India.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. The Indian team is unbeatable at home. II. The Indian team gets the advantage of the home ground.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. "Unbeatable" is an extreme word. The statement only says they are "expected to win," which implies a high chance, not a certainty. Does not follow.<br>II. The reason given for the expectation of winning is that the match is in India. This directly means the home ground provides an advantage. Follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 7:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> Company X has been certified with ISO 9001, which is a mark of quality.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Company X produces high-quality products. II. ISO 9001 is the only mark of quality.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only I follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. If the company has a mark of quality, it can be logically concluded that it produces quality products. Follows.<br>II. The statement says ISO 9001 is "a" mark of quality, not the "only" mark of quality. There could be others. Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 8:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The government has banned all plastic bags below 50 microns to reduce pollution.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Plastic bags below 50 microns are a major source of pollution. II. This ban will completely eliminate plastic pollution.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only I follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The government takes action to target the source of a problem. Banning these specific bags implies they are considered a significant source of pollution. Follows.<br>II. "Completely eliminate" is too strong. This ban addresses one type of plastic; other types of plastic pollution may still exist. Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 9:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> To maintain good health, one must have a balanced diet.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. A balanced diet is sufficient for good health. II. People who do not have a balanced diet are unhealthy.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The statement says a balanced diet is *necessary* ("must have"), but not that it is *sufficient*. Other things like exercise might also be needed. Does not follow.<br>II. If having a balanced diet is a necessity for good health, then it logically follows that not having one will lead to being unhealthy. Follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 10:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> All students who passed the exam attended the special classes.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. The special classes were effective. II. Only those who attended special classes passed the exam.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only I follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. Since every student who passed had attended the classes, it's a strong indication that the classes were effective in helping them pass. Follows.<br>II. This is the converse of the statement, which is not necessarily true. It's possible that some students attended the classes but still failed. The statement says "All who passed, attended", not "All who attended, passed". Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>

                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 11:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> A recent study shows that children who play a musical instrument have better cognitive skills than those who do not.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Playing a musical instrument is the only way to improve cognitive skills. II. Playing a musical instrument helps in the development of cognitive skills.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The word "only" makes this too extreme. The study shows a correlation, not an exclusive cause. Does not follow.<br>II. The study showing that players have "better" skills directly implies that the activity is beneficial and helps in their development. Follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 12:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The condition of the national highways is deteriorating in several states due to the lack of proper maintenance.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. The government is not providing enough funds for the maintenance of national highways. II. Proper maintenance can improve the condition of national highways.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. Lack of funds is a *possible reason* for the lack of maintenance, but not a definite conclusion. Other reasons could be corruption or inefficiency. Does not follow.<br>II. The statement says deterioration is "due to the lack of proper maintenance". This directly implies that if proper maintenance were done, the condition would improve. Follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 13:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> Although he is a brilliant student, he has failed to secure a good job.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Brilliant students usually get good jobs. II. Being brilliant is not the only criterion for getting a good job.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Both I and II follow</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The word "Although" signifies a contrast to what is generally expected. The expectation is that brilliant students get good jobs. Follows.<br>II. The fact that a brilliant student failed to get a good job proves that academic brilliance alone is not sufficient. Other criteria must exist. Follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 14:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The availability of online courses has democratized education, allowing people to learn new skills.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Traditional universities are no longer relevant. II. Access to the internet is a key factor in skill development today.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The statement says online courses are an addition/expansion of opportunity. It doesn't imply the obsolescence of traditional institutions. Does not follow.<br>II. Since the positive change is attributed to "online courses", it logically follows that access to the platform (the internet) is a key component. Follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 15:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> Most of the students who appeared for the final engineering examination have passed.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Some students have failed. II. The examination was very easy.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only I follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The word "Most" implies not "All". If most passed, it logically means some did not pass (i.e., failed). Follows.<br>II. The reason why most students passed is not stated. We cannot definitively conclude it was easy. Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 16:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The new anti-pollution law has banned all vehicles older than 15 years in the city. However, the number of people suffering from respiratory diseases has not decreased.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. The law has been completely ineffective. II. Vehicular pollution is not the only cause of respiratory diseases in the city.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. "Completely ineffective" is too strong. The law might have reduced vehicular pollution, but other factors could have kept the disease rate the same. Does not follow.<br>II. Since banning a major pollution source did not decrease the diseases, it logically follows that there must be other significant causes. Follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 17:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> A recent report states that a single banyan tree can support an entire ecosystem of birds, insects, and small animals.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Cutting down banyan trees will have a negative impact on the local ecosystem. II. Banyan trees are more important than all other types of trees.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only I follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. If a banyan tree supports an ecosystem, its removal will logically have a negative impact. Follows.<br>II. The statement highlights the importance of the banyan tree but doesn't compare it to "all other types". Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 18:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> India's economic growth has been one of the highest in the world, but it has not led to a proportional increase in job creation.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. The economic growth in India is not labor-intensive. II. India's economic growth is not real.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only I follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. Growth in output without similar growth in jobs implies the growth is happening in sectors that do not require a large workforce, i.e., it is not labor-intensive. Follows.<br>II. The statement affirms that "economic growth has been one of the highest". To conclude it is "not real" directly contradicts the statement. Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 19:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The prices of vegetables have soared in the market during the last few days.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Vegetables are becoming a rare commodity. II. People cannot eat vegetables.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> D) Neither I nor II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. "Soared" prices mean they are expensive, not necessarily "rare". Rarity is a possible cause but not a definite conclusion. Does not follow.<br>II. "Cannot eat" is too extreme. High prices might mean people eat less, but not that they are completely unable to eat them. Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 20:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> In a recent survey, a majority of people reported that they prefer Brand X soap over Brand Y soap.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Brand X soap is better in quality than Brand Y soap. II. Brand X soap is cheaper than Brand Y soap.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> D) Neither I nor II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>The statement is about preference, which is subjective. We cannot definitively conclude the reason for this preference. It could be quality (I), price (II), better marketing, or availability. Neither I nor II is a guaranteed conclusion.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 21:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The use of non-conventional sources of energy will eliminate the energy crisis in the world.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. Modern technology is slowly replacing the conventional sources of energy. II. The conventional sources of energy are inexhaustible.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> D) Neither I nor II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The statement is a suggestion for the future ("will eliminate"). It doesn't state that the replacement is already happening. Does not follow.<br>II. The very need to find alternatives to conventional sources implies that they are limited or exhaustible. This conclusion contradicts the tone of the statement. Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 22:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The manager humiliated Sachin in the presence of his colleagues.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. The manager did not like Sachin. II. Sachin was not popular with his colleagues.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only I follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. Humiliating someone in public is a strong indicator of dislike or disapproval. This is a reasonable and direct inference from the action. Follows.<br>II. How Sachin's colleagues feel about him cannot be determined from the manager's action. They might sympathize with him. Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 23:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> According to a report, 90% of the city's lakes have been encroached upon.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. The city's civic body is not vigilant enough. II. Encroachment is a serious problem in the city.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. Lack of vigilance is a possible reason but not a definite conclusion. There could be legal loopholes or other issues. Does not follow.<br>II. The fact that 90% of a major civic feature (lakes) has been encroached upon directly leads to the conclusion that encroachment is a serious issue. Follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 24:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> All the flowers in the garden are red. Most of the red flowers are roses.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. All flowers in the garden are roses. II. Some flowers in the garden are not roses.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only II follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. "Most" red flowers are roses, not "all". Since all flowers in the garden are red, it means most (but not all) flowers in the garden are roses. So, this conclusion is false.<br>II. If most flowers are roses, it logically implies that some flowers are not roses. Follows.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 25:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The Prime Minister emphasized that the government is committed to the welfare of the farmers.<br><strong>Conclusions:</strong> I. The farmers in the country are in a bad state. II. The government has not done anything for the farmers in the past.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Only I follows</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. Emphasizing commitment to the "welfare" of a group usually happens when that group is facing problems or is in a poor state. This is a strong, logical inference. Follows.<br>II. The statement is about a present commitment. It does not provide any information to make a definite conclusion about the past. Does not follow.</p></div></details></li>
